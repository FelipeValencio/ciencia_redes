  "plain": "Tupac Amaru Shakur, known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli, was an actor and a highly influential rapper who is considered by many to be the greatest of all time due to the revolutionary spirit and thug passion he mixed into his music. During his music career, he made appearances in movies such as his acclaimed debut in Juice (1992), Poetic Justice (1993), and Above the Rim (1994).\n\nBorn June 16, 1971 in Harlem, New York City to Black Panther Party members Billy Garland and Afeni Shakur, Tupac would later move to Baltimore before settling in the Bay Area cities of Oakland and Marin City in the late 1980s. There, he joined his first rap group Strictly Dope with Ray Luv before connecting with Shock G and Digital Underground. He was a roadie and backup dancer for the group before his breakthrough performance in January 1991 on their track \u201cSame Song.\u201d\n\n2Pac released his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in November 1991, and the album featured intense storytelling on singles such as \u201cTrapped\u201d and \u201cBrenda\u2019s Got a Baby\u201d along with the more upbeat single \u201cIf My Homie Calls.\u201d His sophomore album Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z featured one of his signature songs, the Digital Underground-assisted \u201cI Get Around.\u201d After working on the Thug Life group album in 1994, 2Pac released Me Against the World the following year, which is considered by many to be his best album. It peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200 and received a Best Rap Album Grammy nomination\u2014all while he sat in prison.\n\n2Pac subsequently joined Death Row Records after they posted his $1.4 million bond in October 1995 and he almost immediately hit the studio to work on his double album All Eyez On Me, which was released in February 1996 and achieved diamond status with over 10 million sales thanks to hits such as \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d with Dr. Dre, \u201c2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\u201d with Snoop Dogg, and \u201cHow Do U Want It\u201d with K-Ci & JoJo.\n\nDuring his time with Death Row, 2Pac was seen as a catalyst for the East Coast-West Coast feud of the mid-1990s as he targeted Bad Boy Entertainment\u2019s two main figures\u2014Puff Daddy and The Notorious B.I.G.\u2014who he thought were involved in his 1994 shooting at Quad Recording Studios in New York City. 2Pac also dissed several other East Coast stars, including JAY-Z, Nas, and Mobb Deep on songs such as \u201cHit \u2018Em Up,\u201d \u201cBomb First (My Second Reply),\u201d and \u201cAgainst All Odds\u201d among other unreleased tracks.\n\nOn September 7, 1996, after attending the Bruce Seldon-Mike Tyson WBA Heavyweight Championship title fight at the MGM Grand, Shakur was shot multiple times in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where he died six days later on Friday the 13th.\n\nApproximately two months after his death, 2Pac\u2019s Makaveli album was released and hit #1 on the Billboard 200 before achieving triple platinum status within six months of its release. Tupac\u2019s mother, Afeni, ended up getting the rights to his unreleased music from Death Row and released several posthumous compilations through her Amaru Entertainment label. In 2017, 2Pac was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. To date, 2Pac has sold over 75 million albums worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. On June 7, 2023, Tupac Shakur received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and on November 3, 2023, a stretch of MacArthur Boulevard in Oakland, California was named \u201cTupac Shakur Way\u201d in his honor."

Should I blast myself?\nI'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black\nMy stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch\nCops give a damn about a negro\nPull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero\n\"Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?\nOne less hungry mouth on the welfare\"\nFirst ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers\nGive 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other\n\"It's time to fight back,\" that's what Huey said\nTwo shots in the dark, now Huey's dead\nI got love for my brother\nBut we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other\nWe gotta start makin' changes\nLearn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers\nAnd that's how it's supposed to be\nHow can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh\nI'd love to go back to when we played as kids\nBut things change, and that's the way it is\nYou might also like\n(Come on, come on)\nThat's just the way it is (Changes)\nThings'll never be the same\nThat's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)\nAww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)\n(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)\nThat's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)\nThings'll never be the same\n(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)\nThat's just the way it is (Way it is)\nAww, yeah (Come on, come on)\nI see no changes, all I see is racist faces\nMisplaced hate makes disgrace to races\nWe under, I wonder what it takes to make this\nOne better place, let's erase the wasted\nTake the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right\n'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight\nAnd the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)\nIt takes skill to be real, time to heal each other\nAnd although it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)\nIt ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact\nThe penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks\nBut some things will never change (Never change)\nTry to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)\nNow tell me, what's a mother to do?\nBein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)\nYou gotta operate the easy way\n\"I made a G today,\" but you made it in a sleazy way\nSellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), \"I gotta get paid\" (Oh)\nWell hey, well that's the way it is\n(Come on, come on)\nThat's just the way it is (Changes)\nThings'll never be the same\nThat's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)\nAww, yeah (Hear me)\n(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)\nThat's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)\nThings'll never be the same\n(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)\nThat's just the way it is (Way it is)\nAww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)\n\nWe gotta make a change\nIt's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes\nLet's change the way we eat\nLet's change the way we live\nAnd let's change the way we treat each other\nYou see, the old way wasn't workin'\nSo it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive\n\nAnd still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?\nIt's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)\nInstead of war on poverty\nThey got a war on drugs so the police can bother me\nAnd I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do\nBut now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)\nDon't let 'em jack you up, back you up\nCrack you up and pimp-smack you up\nYou gotta learn to hold your own\nThey get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone\nBut tell the cops they can't touch this\nI don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this\nThat's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool\nMy mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)\nAnd as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped\nAnd I never get to lay back\n'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback\nSome buck that I roughed up way back\nComin' back after all these years\n\"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,\" that's the way it is\n(Uh)\nThat's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nThings'll never be the same (Yeah)\nThat's just the way it is (The way it is)\nAww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)\n(I'm tryna make a change)\n(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)\nThat's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)\nThings'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)\nThat's just the way it is, aww, yeah\nSome things'll never change346Embed"

(What's that?)\nWhen brothers make babies\nAnd leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAnd since we all came from a woman\nGot our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)\nI wonder why we take from our women\nWhy we rape our women, do we hate our women?\n(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)\nI think it's time to kill for our women\nTime to heal our women, be real to our women\nAnd if we don't, we'll have a race of babies\nThat will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)\nAnd since a man can't make one\nHe has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one\nSo will the real men get up?\nI know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up\nYou might also like\n(Keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things are gonna get easier\n(Keep-keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things'll get brighter\n(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things are gonna get easier\n(Keep-keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things'll get brighter\n\nAyo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me\nHe had me feelin' like black was the thing to be\nAnd suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough\nAnd though we had it rough, we always had enough\nI huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules\nRan with the local crew and had a smoke or two\nI realize Mama really paid the price\nShe nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)\nAnd all I had to give her was my pipe dream\nOf how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen\nI'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nIt's hard to be legit and still pay your rent\nAnd in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'\nI try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind\nLast night, my buddy lost his whole family\nIt's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)\nIt seems the rain'll never let up\nI try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh\nYou know, it's funny, when it rains it pours\nThey got money for wars, but can't feed the poor\nSaid it ain't no hope for the youth\nAnd the truth is it ain't no hope for the future\nAnd then they wonder why we crazy, huh\nI blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby\nWe ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up\nAnd even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up\n(Keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things are gonna get easier\n(Keep-keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things'll get brighter\n(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things are gonna get easier\n(Keep-keep ya head up)\nOoh, child, things'll get brighter\n\nAnd, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own\nI know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone\nDaddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome\nThank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em\n'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure\nAnd if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)\n'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son\nWants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'\nYou can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand\nWithout a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)\nBecause there's too many things for you to deal with\nDyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless\nWhile the tears is rollin' down your cheeks\nYou're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)\n'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)\nAnd don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)\nAnd now my son's gettin' older and older\nAnd cold from havin' the world on his shoulders\nWhile the rich kids is drivin' Benz\nI'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)\nAnd it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up\nBut, huh, please, you got to keep your head up206Embed"

(Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)\nSweet lady, don't you know we love ya?\n\nPour out some liquor and I reminisce\n'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama\nAnd when it seems that I'm hopeless\nYou say the words that can get me back in focus\nWhen I was sick as a little kid\nTo keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did\nAnd all my childhood memories\nAre full of all the sweet things you did for me\nAnd even though I act crazy\nI gotta thank the Lord that you made me\nThere are no words that can express how I feel\nYou never kept a secret, always stayed real\nAnd I appreciate how you raised me\nAnd all the extra love that you gave me\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, gotta roll on\nAnd there's no way I can pay you back\nBut my plan is to show you that I understand\nYou are appreciated\nLady, don't you know we love ya?

'Cause I ain't mad at cha\nHeard y'all tearin' up shit out there\nKickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck\nYeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha\n\nNow we was once two niggas of the same kind\nQuick to holla at a hoochie with the same line\nYou was just a little smaller, but you still rolled\nGot stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll\n'Member when you had a Jheri curl, didn't quite learn\nOn the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm\nCollect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed\nOh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game\nHeard you might be comin' home, just got bail\nWanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail\nIt seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man\nHit the pen' and now no sinnin' is the game plan\nWhen I talk about money, all you see is the struggle\nWhen I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble\nCongratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know\nShe got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'\nI know we grew apart, you probably don't remember\nI used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her\nAnd I can see us after school, we'd bomb\nOn the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on\nNow the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it\nGot a big money scheme and you ain't even with it\nKnew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that\nGo toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back\nAnd I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha\nYou tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead\n'Cause I ain't mad at cha\nYou might also like\nI ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\n\nWe used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens\nWhole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't\nUsed to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs\nI'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared\nBesides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind\nIn time, we'd learned to live a life of crime\nRewind us back to a time was much too young to know\nI caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow\nAnd even though we separated, you said that you'd wait\nDon't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state\nI kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes\nSaid I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived\nDon't shed a tear, 'cause mama, I ain't happy here\nI blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years\nThey got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs\nIn my cell, thinkin', \"Hell, I know one day I'll be back\"\nAs soon as I touch down\nI told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down\nThe homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha\n'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nA true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha\n\nWell, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now\nBitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down\nHe went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock\nWent from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block\nHe's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's\nMost hated by enemies, escape in the luxury\nSee, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made\nNow we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days\nSo full of pain while the weapons blaze\nGettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days\n'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze\nYou'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days\nSo many changed on me, so many tried to plot\nThat I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?\n'Til God return me to my essence\n'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent\nSo many questions and they ask me if I'm still down\nI moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?\nThey got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha\nYou niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nHell nah, I ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nAnd I ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha\nI ain't mad at cha86Embed"

You're killin' me with your jealousy\nNow my ambition's to be free\nI can't breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap\nI hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucker for love\n\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (That's right, sucker for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)\nWhat you won't do, do for love?\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\nYou might also like\nJust when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy, you tried to trap me\nSaid you're pregnant and guess who the daddy? Don't wanna fall for it\nBut in this case what could I do? So now I'm back\nTo makin' promises to you, tryna keep it true\nWhat if I'm wrong? A trick to keep me holdin' on\nTryna be strong and in the process, keep you goin'\nI'm 'bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close\nTo packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost\nTell me who knows a peaceful place where I can go\nTo clear my head, I'm feelin' low, losin' control\nMy heart is sayin', \"Leave!\" Oh, what a tangled web we weave\nWhen we conspire to conceive, and now\nYou gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'\nThat's all I need to hear, 'cause I'm leavin', I'm out the door\nNever no more you will see me, this is the end\n'Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucker for love\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (Don't, sucker for love)\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (Oh, yeah, sucker for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (Oh, baby)\n\nNow he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay\nAs you sit and pray, hopin' the beatings'll go away\nIt wasn't always a hit-and-run relationship\nIt used to be love, happiness and companionship\nRemember when I treated you good\nI moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood\nMe and you, a happy home, when it was on\nI had a love to call my own\nI should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes\nPreoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie\nYou had a man and I knew it, you told me\nDon't worry 'bout it, we can do it now, I'm under pressure\nMake a decision 'cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone\nI'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh\nI wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness\nBut I need your faith in me, I'm a sucker for love\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (What you won't do for love, sucker for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (That ain't right, I'm a sucker for love)\nWhat you won't do, do for love?\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (No)\n\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)\nWhat you won't do, do for love? (Sucker for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up (Sucker for love)\nWhat you won't do? (Do for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\nWhat you won't do? (Do for love)\nYou tried everything, but you don't give up\nDo for love, yeah, baby, yeah\nDo for love52Embed"

I'm out here all by myself, see\nLadies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy\nPictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'\nSeein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons\nAlready crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child\nHad me scared but left me prepared for a while\nIs there another route for a crooked Outlaw?\nVeteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall\n\nEveryday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less\nI'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'\nScheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'\n'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up\nMy nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up\nGo load the MAC up, now watch me klacka\nTried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'\nAnd evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'\nSo what? Go put some work in and make my mail\nMakin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well\nMe against the world\nWith nothin' to lose (Ooh yeah)\nIt's just me against the world\nIt's just me against the world, baby\nMe against the world\nI got nothin' to lose\nIt's just me against the world\nIt's just me against the world, baby\nWith nothin' to lose\nIt's just me against the world, baby\nMe against the world\nMe against the world\nI got nothin' to lose\nIt's just me against the world, baby\nWith all this extra stressin'\nThe question I wonder is after death, after my last breath\nWhen will I finally get to rest through this oppression?\nThey punish the people that's askin' questions\nAnd those that possess steal from the ones without possessions\nThe message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons\nDon't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions\nBe grateful for blessings\nDon't ever change, keep your essence\nThe power is in the people and politics we address\nAlways do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic\nAnd when you get stranded\nAnd things don't go the way you planned it\nDreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference\nPoliticians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen\nIf I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change\nIt wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world\nMe against the world\nNothin' to lose\nIt's just me against the world, baby\nMe against the world\nGot me stuck in the game (Ooh yeah)\nIt's just me against the world\nNothin' to lose\nIt's just me against the world, baby\nMe against the world\n\nHahaha, that's right\nI know it seem hard sometimes\nBut, uh, remember one thing\nThrough every dark night, there's a bright day after that\nSo no matter how hard it get\nStick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it71Embed"

The world looks dreary\nWhen you wipe your eyes, see it clearly\nThere's no need for you to fear me\nIf you take your time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me\nIt ain't about black or white, \u2018cause we human\nI hope we see the light before it's ruined\nMy ghetto gospel\nYou might also like\nThose who wish to follow me (Ghetto gospel)\nI welcome with my hands\nAnd the red sun sinks at last\nInto the hills of gold\nAnd peace to this young warrior\nWithout the sound of guns\n\nTell me, do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?\nLivin' out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has\nAnd over there, there's a lady\nCrack got her crazy, guess who's givin' birth to a baby?\nI don't trip or let it fade me\nFrom out of the fryin' pan, we jump into another form of slavery\nEven now, I get discouraged\nWonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?\nI refuse to be a role model\nI set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles (Own bottles)\nI make mistakes, but learn from every one\nAnd when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one\nIf I upset you, don't stress\nNever forget that God isn't finished with me yet\nI feel his hand on my brain\nWhen I write rhymes, I go blind and let the Lord do his thing\nBut am I less holy\n'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?\nBefore we find world peace\nWe gotta find peace and end the war in the streets\nMy ghetto gospel\nThose who wish to follow me (Yeah, ghetto gospel)\nI welcome with my hands\nAnd the red sun sinks at last\nInto the hills of gold\nAnd peace to this young warrior\nWithout the sound of guns\n\nLord, can you hear me speak?\nTo pay the price of bein' hellbound100Embed"

Hahaha (Yeah)\nIt's all about you, one time (I'ma say it's all about you, baby, yeah)\nHaha, for the bitches that think it's all about you (It's all about you) (This Dru Down in the house\nWith my boy 'Pizznac, you know what I'm sayin'?)\nIt's all about you (Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you\nBut you know I'm lyin' though, ha! Yeah)\n\nYou probably crooked as the last trick\nWant to laugh at how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch?\nThinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run\nIt's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one\nWise decisions, based on lies we livin'\nScandalous times, this game's like my religion\nYou could be rollin' with a thug\nInstead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love\nIn every club, I see you starin' like you want it\nWell, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it\nLet the liquor help you get up on it\nI'm still tipsy from last night\nBumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life\nI try to holla, but you tell me you taken\nSayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'\nGuess it's true what they tellin' me\nFresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity\nSo that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it\nFantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it? (Hell no)\nAddicted to the things you do\nBut still true what I'm sayin', boo, \u2018cause this is all about you\nYou might also like\nEvery other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes (It's all about you)\nEvery other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\n\nI make a promise if you go with me\nJust let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave\nNobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga\nI only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers\nI love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place\nWitness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes\nHow can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?\nCreep though, weed smoke's in the air\nEverywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes\nWaitin' for niggas at the end of every show\nI just seen you in my friend's video\nCould never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go\nFollow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through\nIt's all about you\nYeah, nigga, it's all about you\n\nEvery other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nEvery other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nIs you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?\nIt ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew\nEvery other city we go and every video\nExplain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?\nYou think it's all about you? Well, boo\nI gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too\n\nYou couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track\nA lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff\nWhen I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll\nStraight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll\nHold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next\nGold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex\n\nI slide in easily, try a grizzly\nSluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me\nRunnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya\nAt the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia\n(It's all about you)\n\nEvery other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nEvery other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nEvery other city we go, every other video (It's all about you)\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nEvery other city we go, every other video\nNo matter where I go, I see the same hoes\nI'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit\nI mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?\nI'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video\nI see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video\nThen I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video\nI see the same bitch that was in my video\nYou know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?\nWhat make that even more fucked up\nI'm watchin' a Million Man March\nAnd I see the same bitch on the Million Man March\nThat was in the homeboy Warren G video!\nI mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go\nI see the same ho\nDon't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah43Embed"

Remember me\nSo many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears\n\nAhh, I suffered through the years\nAnd shed so many tears\nLord, I lost so many peers\nAnd shed so many tears\nYou might also like\nNow that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means\nLabel me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen\nAnd fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed\nI'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse, God, can you feel me?\nTake me away from all the pressure and all the pain\nShow me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind\nI spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well\nI know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?\nMy life is in denial and when I die\nBaptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears\nLord, I suffered through the years and shed so many tears\nLord, I lost so many peers and shed so many tears\n\nNow, I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears\nI'm suicidal, so don't stand near me\nMy every move is a calculated step\nTo bring me closer to embrace an early death, now there's nothin' left\nThere was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest\nI'm barely standin', about to go to pieces, screamin' peace\nAnd though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it\nI had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free\nThey planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame\nInside my brain like a match, such a dirty game\nNo memories, just a misery\nPaintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep\nWill I survive 'til the morning to see the Sun?\nPlease Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come\nLord! (God!) I suffered through the years and shed so many tears\nGod, I lost so many peers and\u2014\n\nLord knows, I tried, been a witness to homicide\nSeen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die\nWonder why as I walk by\nBroken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high\nThis ain't the life for me, I wanna change\nBut ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game\nI'm trapped inside a maze\nSee this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy, disillusioned lately\nI've been really wantin' babies\nSo I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady, don't trust my lady\n'Cause she's a product of this poison\nI'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more\nI'm fallin' to the floor\nBeggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door, shed so many tears (God please help me)\n\nLord, I lost so many years (I suffered through the years) and shed so many tears\nI lost so many peers and shed so many tears\nLord, I suffered through the years and shed so many tears\nGod, I lost so many peers and shed so many tears80Embed"

Loosen up, girl, I ain't going\nNowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there\nWhile he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock\nHold the boots, and let a nigga execute\nAnd though you got it right, I'm going home tonight\nYou say you don't need a man, but I don't care\nYou're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga\n\nI'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)\nSo we can get drunk and smoke weed all day\nIt don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life\nThese busters ain't loving you right\nSo I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)\nSo we can get drunk and smoke weed all day\nIt don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life\nThese busters ain't loving you right\nI'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)\nSo we can get drunk and smoke weed all day\nIt don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life\nThese busters ain't loving you right\nI'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (I'd rather be yo' nigga)\n(I'd rather be yo' nigga)38Embed"

Where do niggas go when we die?\nAin't no heaven for a thug nigga\nThat's why we go to thug mansion\nThat's the only place where thugs get in free\nAnd you gotta be a G, at thug mansion\n\nA place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind\nSo much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times\nI once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried\nBut when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes\nNo one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble\nNot knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you\nPicture me inside the misery of poverty\nNo man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived\nPrayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on\nMe and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on\nWe found a finally spot to kick it\nWhere we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit\nA spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's\nWe still visualize places that we can roll in peace\nAnd in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it\nI got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion\nYou might also like\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nChillin' with homies and family\nSky high, iced out, paradise in the sky\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nOnly place that's right for me\nChromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky\n\nWill I survive all the fights and the darkness?\nTrouble sparks, they tell me: \"Home is where the heart is.\"\nDear departed, I shed tattooed tears\nAnd couldn't sleep good for multiple years\nWitness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares\nSeen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains\nPlease explain why they can't stand us\nIs there a way for me to change?\nOr am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?\nI need a place to rest my head\nWith the little bit of homeboys that remains\n\u2018Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to grow?\nIf you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go\nHow can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom\nWatch my daddy scream \"Peace!\" while the other man shot him\nI need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape\nThe deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nChillin' with homies and family\nSky high, iced out, paradise in the sky\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nOnly place that's right for me\nChromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky\n\nDear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good\nTell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods\nSeen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook\nDrinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke\nThen some lady named Billie Holiday sang\nSittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came\nLittle Latasha sho' grown\nTell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home\nMaybe in time you'll understand\nOnly God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band\nJust think of all the people that you knew in the past\nThat passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last\nPicture a place that they exist, together\nThere has to be a place better than this, in Heaven\nSo right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'\nRemember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nChillin' with homies and family\nSky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (In thugs mansion)\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nOnly place that's right for me\nChromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (Thugs mansion)\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nChillin' with homies and family\nSky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (In thugs mansion)\nAin't no place I'd rather be\nOnly place that's right for me\nChromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky47Embed"

Through the misery that came to pass\nThe hard times make a true friend afraid to ask\nFor currency, but you could run to me when you need\nAnd I'll never leave, honestly\nSomeone to believe in, as you can see\nIt's a small thing to a true, what could I do?\nReal homies help you get through\nAnd come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could\n\u2018Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good\nAnd half the times we be actin' up, call the cops\nBringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block\nIt never stops, when my mama ask me will I change\nI tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same\nUntil the end of time\n\nSo take these broken wings\nI need your hands to come and heal me once again\n(Until the end of time)\nSo I can fly away, until the end of time\nUntil the end of time, until the end of time\nYou might also like\nPlease, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin\nMy hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids\nSo you know, I don't hang around the house much\nThis all-night money makin' got me outta touch\nShit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while\nAn unexpected birth worst of the ghetto trials\nMy attitude got me walkin' solo\nRide out alone in my lo-lo\nWatchin' the whole world move in slow-mo, huh\nFor quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean\nSmokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'\nWho can I trust in this cold world?\nMy phony homie had a baby by my old girl\nBut I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him\nI sexed his sister, had him mumblin'\nLike a Mexican\nHis next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen\nBesides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'\nUntil the end of time\n\nSo take these broken wings\nI need your hands to come and heal me once again\n(Until the end of time)\nSo I can fly away, until the end of time\nUntil the end of time, until the end of time\nNow who's to say if I was right or wrong\nTo live my life as an outlaw all along?\nRemain strong in this planet full of player haters\nThey conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators\nAnd in the end, drinkin' Hennessy\nMade all my enemies envy me\nSo cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily\nFalls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe\nWhile beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)\nWhen I conceive closer to achieve\nIn times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G\nFollow my lead, I'll supply everything you need\nAn ounce of game and the training to make a G\nRemember me as an outcast Outlaw\nAnother album out, that's what I'm about: more\nGettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket\nBuried as a G while the whole world remembers me\nUntil the end of time\n\nSo take these broken wings\nI need your hands to come and heal me once again\n(Until the end of time)\nSo I can fly away, until the end of time\nUntil the end of time, until the end of time34Embed"

Starin'\n\nMultiple gunshots clear the block, the fun stops\nSnitches is callin' cops, people shot, nobody stops\nI wonder when the world stopped carin'\nLast night two kids shot while the whole block starin'\nI will never understand this society\nFirst they try to murder me, then they lie to me\nProduct of a dyin' breed; all my homies tryin' weed\nNow the little babies crazed, raised off Hennessy\nTell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?\nBelieve me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy\nListen, through intermissions, search your heart for a plan\nAnd we turnin' bad boys to grown men, it's on again\nI give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners\nRoll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya\nOne love from a thug nigga\nRollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers\nTo the end, my friend, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true\nWhile I'm starin' at the world through my rearview\nSee, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true\nWhile I'm starin' at the world through my rearview\nYou might also like\nThey got me starin' at the world through my rearview\nGo on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you\nI can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die\nGettin' high, watchin' time fly\nAnd all my motherfuckers\nStarin' at the world through my rearview\nGo on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you\nI can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die\nGettin' high, watchin' time fly\nAnd all my motherfuckers\n\nNow you see him, now you don't\nSome niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone\nWhat happened to 'em?\nWell, let's see, it seems to be a mystery\nBut all I know I never let the money get to me\nStay down like the truest\nThug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this\nWho is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?\nWhile you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview\nHear you is down with them Outlawz\nOutcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws\nBut still we keep mashin' until our dreams come through\nStarin' at the world through my rearview\nNow, I was raised as a young black male\nIn order to get paid, forced to make crack sales\nCaught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails\nIn the cell, countin' days in this livin' black hell\nDo you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion\nRoll with a 12 gauge pump for protection\nNiggas hate me in the section, from years of chin-checkin'\nTurn to Smith & Wesson war weapons\nHeavenly Father, I'm a soldier\nI'm gettin' hotter 'cause the world's gettin' colder\nBaby, let me hold ya: talk to my guns like they fly bitches\nAll you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!\n\nNow I know the answers to the question, \u201cDo dreams come true?\u201d\nStill starin' at the world through my rearview\nI said, now I know the answer, \u201cDo dreams come true?\u201d\nStarin' at the world through my rearview\n\nThey got me starin' at the world through my rearview\nGo on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you\nI can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die\nGettin' high, watchin' time fly\nAnd all my motherfuckers\nStarin' at the world through my rearview\nGo on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you\nI can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die\nGettin' high, watchin' time fly\nNigga, Kadafi say!\n\nBack in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers\n'9-6 for Glocks\n'Cause fiends hittin' up blocks with street sweepers\nBless myself when knowin' rules to these streets\nSomethin' I learned in school\nOn some Million Man March shit for the peace\nTrue that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed\nCriminally addicted, infested since a seed\nWe all die, breed, bleed like humans\nTowns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants\nShit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go\nBurnt my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough\nSo while you reminiscin' all nights out with the crew\nSmoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin' through your rearview\n\nHahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview\nSo, since you ain't knowin' what we mean, let me break it better understandin' the world\u2026The world is behind us\nOnce a motherfucker get an understandin' on the game, and what the levels and the rules of the game is\nThen the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played\nSo, now we lookin' at the world from, high watch, behind us\nNiggas know what we gotta do: just gotta put our mind to it and do it, it's all about the papers, money rule the world\nBitches make the world go round\nReal niggas do what they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can\n\nThey got me starin' at the world through my rearview\nGo on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you\nI can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die\nGettin' high, watchin' time fly\nAnd all my motherfuckers\nStarin' at the world through my rearview\nGo on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you\nI can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die\nGettin' high, watchin' time fly26Embed"

Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from \"Hawaiian Sophie\" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac \u2013 rather Makaveli \u2013 was not available for comment but released this statement:\n\nIt's not about East or West\nIt's about niggas and bitches\nPower and money, ridaz and punks\nWhich side are you on?\n*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*\n*Encroaching footsteps*\nThese niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?\nYou niggas still breathin'?

Yay-yay!\nWest Coast rider, comin' right behind ya\nShould have never fucked with me\nI want money, hoes, sex and weed\nI won't rest until my road dog's free \u2013 bomb first\nYou might also like\nWe bomb first when we ride\nPlease reconsider 'fore you die\nWe ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight\nBut it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first\nWe bomb first when we ride\nPlease reconsider 'fore you die\nWe ain't even come to fight tonight\nBut it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first\n\nFor so many days, in so many ways we've been duckin' strays\nThey delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers\nGot nuttin' to lose, I gots nowhere to go\nI only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row\nWith Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general\nAnd I be a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do\nAnd that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause\nYou best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch, yo I'm dyin' with yours\nKamikaze, sicker than a ma'fuckin' Nazi\nGot a little question for that nigga that made \"Paparazzi\"\nIf you ain't in this rap game for the motherfuckin' cash, mane\nThen what is your motherfuckin' purpose?

I'm a thug 'til I die; I'm a rider, mane\nTouch bases, eat lunch in plush places\nRegular criminal oasis awaits us\nIf there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there\nAnd I'm sorry for not bein' there\nJust know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World\nBless the boys and all my little girls\nTo the Lord: I'm eternal, restin' in peace\nPlease take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child\n\nPlease take care of all my kids and my unborn child\nTo my unborn child\nThis letter goes out to my seeds\nThat I might not get to see 'cause of this lifestyle\nJust know your daddy loved you\nGot nothin' but love for you\nAnd all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had\n'Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind\nWhen you get to be my age, you'll understand\nJust know I got love for you\nAnd I'll see you if there's a ghetto in Heaven\nIf there's a Ghetto Heaven, I'll be there waitin' for you\nHeh heh, take care, run wild, but be smart\nFollow the rules of the game\nI know sometimes there's confusion\nRules of the game is gonna get you through it all day every day\nWatch out for these snakes and fakes\nFriends come a dime-a-dozen\nBe an individual, work hard\nStudy, get your mind sharp, trust nobody19Embed"

Out slangin' with the homies\nFuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs!\nGot my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide\nMy city's full of gang-bangers and drive-by's\nWhy do we die at an early age?\nHe was so young, but still a victim of the 12 gauge\nMy memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts\nAnd I ain't goin' back to court, so fuck what you thought!\nI'm drinkin' Hennessy, runnin' from my enemies\nWill I live to be 23? There's so much pain\nYou might also like\nOhhhh\u2026\nTired of the strain and the pain\nOhhhh\u2026\nTired of the strain and the pain\n\nYears and years of that rough life\nRunnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife\nAnd livin' trifed on the regular, buckin' out competitors\nSee 'em fake a move and chase 'em down like the fuckin' Predator\nGet in trouble every day in school, act a fool\nAnd you know I had to break every rule\nShowin' off for the bitches 'cause I had the mad rep\nSo I had to watch my back when it was time to step\nBut my grimies is the grimiest with love for me\nPop, pop, pop, and send a sucka up above for me\nAyo, currency kept passin' me by, but I didn't cry, broke\nGot hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke\nAnd now the money's lookin' lovely\nPop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me\nKick 'em the game, it's all the same\nI kick it back yo, give 'em slack yo\nAnd now they label me the mack yo, people check it\nGet disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man\nCatch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand\nDamn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit\nYou know you get yo' ass twisted, so run for cover\nMe and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust\nSo if you owe, nigga, look for the gauge to bust\nA lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game\nAnd my mama always cryin' yo, there's so much pain\nOhhhh\u2026\nSo tired, so tired...\nOhhhh\u2026\nSo...so...\n\nThey got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed, and ready to get my slug on\nI load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on\nI ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me\nTrust \u2013 I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me\nBust \u2013 on motherfuckers with a passion\nBetter duck, \u2018cause I ain't lookin' when I'm b-blastin'\nI'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy\nAnd gettin' high, on the lookout for my enemies\nDon't wanna die, tell me why\n'Cause this stress is gettin' major\nA buck 50 across the face with my razor\nWhat can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?\nI keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong\nThese sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep\nI'm real, they cannot see\nAnd every day is just a struggle steady thuggin' on the streets\nAnd I'll be ballin', loc, don't let 'em make you worry\nKeep swingin' at these suckas 'til you buried\nI was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta\nWord to mother, I'm touched\nOut kickin' dust up, ready to bust\nI'm on the scene, steady muggin' mean, until they kill me\nI'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me; there's so much pain\nOhhh\u2026\nTired of the strain and the pain\nOhhh\u2026\nTired of the strain and the pain\nOhhh\u2026\nTired of the strain and the pain\nOhhh\u2026\nTired of the strain and the pain\nOhhhhhh\u202638Embed"

When I created rhyme\nFor the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride\nOur intention to ride, every time, all night\nI'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar\nFor me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride\nBreakin' in gas with a .68 all day\nIn-and-out with my pay, assume to count the bodies\n\nSo mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation\nSo you could be more familiar with the nigga you facin'\nWe must be patient, nothin' better than communication\nKnown to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations\nSorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination\nGive up to fate, and get that ass shakin'\nI'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic\nDon't take your life for granted\nPut that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted\nMy lyrics motivate the planet\nIt's similar to \"Rhythm Nation\", but thugged out, forgive me, Janet\nWho's in control? I'm activatin' your souls\nYou know the way the games gettin' told\nYo, two years ago, a friend of mine\nTold me Aliz\u00e9 and Cristal blows your mind\nBear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote\nTakin' off my coat, clearin' my throat\nYou might also like\nI got my mind made up, come on (Come on)\nGet in, get into it (Get on it)\nLet it ride (Get with it), tonight's the night\nI got my mind made up, come on\nGet in, get into it (To it)\nLet it ride, tonight's the night\n\nWell, I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylac's\nFor protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse (Uh)\n'Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays\nSendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave\nI wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs\nShows my heart's as cold as the tundra\nElectrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much\nRough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch\nI'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay\nYou got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei\nMy rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind\nAs the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm\nThere's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'\nI use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'\nOpposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain\nLaughter enhances the chances of the killin'\nWhy is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive\nYou best believe, to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease\nMy thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe\nYour whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees (Uh)\nIn the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics\nMy verbal snipe your vocab on site\nI'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all\nSo all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall (Yeah)\nShould already have an idea about the superior sphere\nThe greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator (Equation)\nI rock from here to there, to Philly and back\nTo L.A., on the spot where I rock and bust like straps\nAs your views get overshadowed when you come in contact\nBeware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat\nFuck you losers\nWhile you fake jacks, I make maneuvers\nLike Hitler stickin' up **** with German ****\nThe mister Meth-Tical from Staten Isle\nWill be back after this message, don't touch the dial (Yeah)\nRarely do you see an MC out for justice\nGot my gun powder and my musket, blaow\nMelons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan\nHalf of my clans repeat felons\nNiggas best protect they joints for nine-nickels\nMan, I stay on point like icicles\nNow, who wanna test Tical, then tes-ticles\nAll up in your motherfuckin' mouth\nHeadbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie\nMethod Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me\nBetter take one and pass or that's that ass\nYour vital statistics are low and fallin' fast\nJohnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash\nPlay a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast\n\nAyo, lyrical gat spittin' the criminal tactics\nNon-believers get my dick and genital backwards\nLet's face it, there's no replacement\nTaste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with\nAvalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted\nFunk Doctor, who? Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted\nI got connects like Federal Express\nTo get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch\nGot the clear spot from the rear block\nTo bust 'til every nigga here drop, men, I fear not\nHold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop\nSince your crew suit you to shift\nNow, you claim that your gears locked\nWhiff this underground cannabis\nI'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst\nFlip MCs like ki's\nMy degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs\nLick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake\nSo I erase the whole front row at the wake\nI planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake\nBust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place\nConfidence for you shaky-ass folks\nPump for Rockafella for the day he got smoke\nChoke off this antidote, got you hope\nGet roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt\n(And I'm out for nine-nickel)\nI-N-S the Rebel\nWist, bliss, this\nSis', bliss40Embed"

I know it's time for you\nSo grab one by the hand, you know what I'm sayin'?\nAnd uh, throw up that finger!\nHey yo, throw y'all fingers up!\nThug style, baby, thug style, y'know?\n\nTell me, baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya\nI can help ya if you only let me touch ya\nIf I'm wrong, love, tell me 'cause I get caught up\nIn the life I live, it's Hell see, I never thought I'd\nSee the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?\nI've been known to clown and get around, that's my word\nSee you walking and you looking good, yes indeed\nGot a body like a sex fiend, you're killing me\nWith your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony\n'Cause I hate it when you act like you don't know me\nI've been stressing in the spotlight, I want the fame\nBut the industry's a lot like a crap game\nAin't no time for commitment, I gotta go\nCan't be with you every minute miss another show\nAnd even though I'm known for my one night stand (Look here)\nI wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...\nYou might also like\nHeyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy\nThrow up the finger!\nHeyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy\nAnd all my homies go\nHeyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy\nGive 'em the finger!\nHeyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy\nYou know what, baby, it's like...\n\nI know you've been searching for someone\nTo make you happy and get the job done\nYou say you needed a man with money\nBut I can't be there, and will you still care?\n\nWill I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows\nGetting weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go\nIn my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high\nI can hear the people calling I'm passing by\nEverybody knows I'm balling and to God\nGotta keep myself from falling, but it's hard\nAll the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?\nGetting shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool\nShould I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide\nIf you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie\nMove close and let me whisper some dirty words\nIn your ears as I kiss ya on every curve\nSlow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow\nCan't hold it any longer, so let it go\nOpen the gates to your waterfall up in Heaven\nAnd don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was..\nHeyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy\nGive 'em the finger!\nHeyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy\nAnd all my homies go\nHeyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy\nGive 'em the finger!\nHeyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy\nIt's just the thug in me\nYou know what, baby, it's like...\n\nI know you've been searchin' for someone\nTo make you happy and get the job done\nYou say you needed a man with money\nBut I can't be there, and will you still care?\n\nA lot of people think it's easy to settle down\nGot a woman that'll please me in every town\nI don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation\nGot me ready to release the fluid, sensation\nSit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand\n'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand\nEven the hardest of my homies need attention\nCatch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'\nI wanna take you to the movies and the park\nA quiet spot for you to do me in the dark\nNow that it's passion, hold me tight\nDon't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight\nI know your man ain't lovin' you right\nYou're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life\nEnough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'\nSee you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was\u2014\nGive 'em the finger, and all my homies go\nYo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?\nThrow your fingers up!\nYou know? They gonna peep this\nThis how we run game on you\nAll my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!\nThrow your hands up, give 'em the finger!29Embed"

Give me that bass line, I'm feelin' bomb\nDeath Row, baby, don't be alarmed\nThe homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again\nRepresent, 'cause I've been sent, the hearts of men24Embed"

I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\nI remember Mr. Magic, Flash, Grandmaster Caz\nLL, Raising Hell, but, that didn't last\nEric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me\nI flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D\nAnd Red Alert was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill\nHad my homies on the hill gettin' ill, when shit was real\nWent out to steal\nRemember Raw, with Daddy Kane?\nWhen De La Soul was puttin' Potholes in the game\nI can't explain how it was, Whodini\nHad me puffin' on that buddha gettin' buzzed, 'cause there I was\nThem block parties in the projects and on my block\nYou diggy don't stop sippin' on that Private Stock\nThrough my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte\nListen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night\nWith T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic\nRemember \"Push It\" was the bomb shit, nuttin' like the old school\nYou might also like\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\nI had, Shell Toes, and BVD's\nA killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets\nI'm playin' skelly, Ringolevio, or catch a kiss\nBefore the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch\nI remember way back, the weak weed they had\nToo many seeds in the trey bag\nI'm on the train headin' uptown, freestyling\nWith some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin'\n'Cause the hoochies was starin', thinkin' \"what them niggas wearin'?\"\nI'm wonderin' if that's her hair, I remember\nStickball, humpin' hoochies on the wall\nOr takin' leaks on the steps, stinkin' up the hall\nThrough my childhood, wild as a juvenile\nA young nigga tryna stay away from Rikers Isle\nMe and my homies breakin' nights, tryna keep it true\nOut on the roof sippin' 90 proof, ain't nuttin' like the old school\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\nRemember poppin' and lockin' to Kurtis Blow, the name belts\nAnd Scott LaRock the Super Ho back in Latin Quarter\nWhen Slick Rick was spittin' La Di Da Di\nGamin' the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties\nI remember, breakdancin' to Melle Mel\nJekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells\nForget the TV, I'd rather hit the streets and do graffiti\nBe careful don't let the transit cops see me\nIt ain't nuttin' like the old school!\n\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\n\"What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today\nIf the old school didn't pave the way\"\nHaha, on the real though\nRemember seein' Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin' party?\nRemember motherfuckers used to go, \"Is Brooklyn in the house?\"\nAnd motherfuckers would lose they goddamn mind!\nThat's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin' (Super Rhyme)\nI remember goin' places that motherfuckers was scared to say\nThey was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb\nBack in the motherfuckin' old school nigga\nRemember skelly, nigga? Knockin' niggas out the box, poppin' boxes?(My Adidas)\nRemember stickball? Member niggas to run that shit like that?\nRemember the block-- 'Member screamin' up at your moms from the window?\n(LL Cool J is hard as Hell...)\nThe ice cream truck, remember all the mother--\n'Member the Italian Ices, yo? Yo, remember the Italian Ices?!\nThe Spanish Niggas comin' down with the coconut ices and shit?\nI came through the door, said it before\nThat was the shit!32Embed"

Pleeeeeease...\n(Nah)\nOh aight \u2013 what's wrong with your eye?\nWhy you got on glasses?\n\nEver since I met ya I could peep the pressure\nIt's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya\nI can see your state of misery from the introduction\nAin't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion\nMaybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day\nLate night phone conversations \u2013 would that be OK?\nI don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line\nTell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind\nI can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you\nThe anticipation of love makin'\nGot you shakin' when I'm standin' near you\nNews of precision will prepare ya\nIn case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror\nNow the picture's gettin' clearer\nAll he does is hit you hard\nI tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God\nI don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home\nI wonder should I leave you alone\nAnd find a woman of my own\nAll the homies tell me that you don't deserve it\nI contemplate \u2013 but in my heart I know you worth it\nTell me, can you get away?\nYou might also likeEbony, can you get away?\nC'mon\u2026 Let's go\u2026 Can you get away?\nCan you get away?\n\nSo much pressure in the air (I know, I know)\nAnd I can't get away (Just for a little while love)\nI'm not happy here (I know it's hard but, can you get away?)\nSo much pressure in the air\n(Let's go man, get up outta there, can you get away?)\nAnd I can't get away (Do you love him?)\nI'm not happy here (Do you love that man?)\n\nCould it be my destiny to be lonely?\nAin't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me\n\u2018Cause they phony\nBut you was different, I got no need to be suspicious\n\u2018Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious\nThe way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted\nI'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it\nEven though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it\nSlowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it\nYou blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'\nNow your heart's tooken\nMy only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook\nWanna take you there but you scared to follow\nCome see tomorrow\nHopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow\nLet you know I care \u2013 that someone's there for your struggle\nDepend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble\nI wanna give you happiness and maybe even more\nI told you before, no time to waste\nWe can hook up at the store.

What makes you ashamed of bein' black?\"\n\nNothin' but love for you, my sister\nMight even know how hard it is, no doubt\nBein' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt\nShit, in this white man's world\nSometimes we overlook the fact\nThat we be ridin' hard on our sisters\nWe don't be knowin' the pain we be causin'\nIn this white man's world\nIn this white man's world\nI ain't sayin I'm innocent in all this\nI'm just sayin', in this white man's world\nThis song is for y'all\nFor all those times that I messed up, or we messed up\n\nDear sister, got me twisted up in prison, I miss ya\nCryin', lookin' at my niece's and my nephew picture\nThey say don't let this cruel world get ya\nKinda suspicious, swearin' one day you might leave me\nFor somebody that's richer\nTwist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow\nGotta make it if I have to beg or borrow\nReadin' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet\nIf brothers don't receive they mail, best believe we riot\nEatin' Jack-Mack, starin' at the walls of silence\nInside this cage where they capture all my rage and violence\nIn time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches\nApologies to my true sisters, far from bitches\nHelp me raise my Black nation, reparations are due\nIt's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you\nSo tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls\nBorn black in this white man's world\u2014and all I heard was\nYou might also like\nWho knows what tomorrow brings\nIn this world where everyone's blind?\nAnd where to go, no matter how far, I'll find\nTo let you know that you're not alone\n\nOnly thing they ever did wrong (Yes!, yes!) was bein' born black (no doubt), in this white man\u2019s world. All my ghetto motherfuckers, be proud to be black if you proud to have this shit like this, 'cause ain't nobody got it like this (all my little black seeds, born black in the white man's world). All these motherfuckers wanna be like us. They all wanna be like us, to be the have-nots: all hail. God bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin' doubt.\n\nBein' born with less, I must confess, only adds on to the stress\nTwo gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest\nShot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see\nI pass his casket, gently askin', is there a heaven for G's?\nMy homeboy's doin' life, his baby mama be stressin'\nSheddin' tears when her son finally ask that questions\nWhere my daddy at? Mama, why we live so poor?\nWhy you cryin'? Heard you late night through my bedroom door\nNow, do you love me, mama? Why they keep on callin' me nigga?\nGet my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger\nAnd still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block\nHearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishin' they'd stop\nProud to be black, but why we act like we don't love ourselves?\nDon't look around, busta, (You sucka!) check yourselves\nKnow what it means to be black, whether a man or girl\nWe still strugglin' in this white man's world\nWho knows what tomorrow brings\n(Born black in this white man's world)\nIn this world where everyone's blind?\n(In this white man's world)\nAnd where to go, no matter how far, I'll find\n(In this white man's world)\nTo let you know that you're not alone\n\nWe must fight for brother Mumia\nWe must fight for brother Mutulu\nAnd we must fight for brother Ruchell Magee\nWe must fight for brother Geronimo Pratt\nWe must fight for , Zulu, \nWe must fight for the countless political prisoners\nWho are locked up falsely by this white man\n\nSo, tell me why you changed to choose a new direction\nIn the blink of an eye?\nMy time away just made perfection\nDid you think I'd die?\nNot gon' cry, why should I care?\nLike we holdin' onto lost love that's no longer there\nCan you please help me?\nGod bless me, please keep my seeds healthy\nMakin' all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy\nHopin' they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells\nJust in case they trip in Heaven\u2014ain't no G's in Hell\nSister, sorry for the pain that I caused your heart\nI know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart\nRest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato\nToo much for this cold world to take, ended up bein' fatal\nEvery woman in America, especially black\nBear with me, can't you see that we under attack?\nI never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama\nHope we make it to better times, in this white man's world\nWho knows what tomorrow brings\nIn this world where everyone's blind?\nAnd where to go, no matter how far, I'll find\nTo let you know that you're not alone\n\n\"You're out of touch with reality! There are a few of you in a few smoke-filled rooms calling that the mainstream, while the masses of the people\u2014white and black, red, yellow and brown, poor and vulnerable\u2014are suffering in this nation.\"\n\nNever that, in this white man's world, they can't stop us\nWe've been here all this time\nThey ain't took us out, they can never take us out\nNo matter what they say, about us bein' extinct\nAbout us bein' endangered species\nWe ain't never gon' leave this\nWe ain't never gon' walk off this planet\nUnless y'all choose to\nUse your brain, use your brain\nIt ain't them that's killin' us, it's us that's killin' us\nIt ain't them that's knockin' us off\nIt's us that's knockin' us off\nI'm tellin' you better watch it, or be a victim\nBe a victim, in this white man's world\nBorn black, in this white man's world, no doubt\nAnd it's dedicated to my motherfuckin' teachers\nMutulu Shakur, Geronimo Pratt, Mumia Abu Jamal\nSekou Odinga, all the real OG's, we out\n\n\"The seal, and the constitution, reflect the thinking of the founding fathers, that this was to be a nation by white people; and for white people, Native Americans, Blacks, and all other non-white people were to be the burden bearers, for the real citizens of this nation.\"7Embed"

I get around\nCali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now\nStill down for that Death Row sound, searchin' for paydays\nNo longer Dre Day\nArrivederci, blown and forgotten, rotten for plottin' child's play\nCheck your sexuality, as fruity as this Aliz\u00e9\nQuick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move\nCross Death Row, now who you gon' run to?\nLaugh at you suckers 'cause you similar\nPretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature\nScreaming \"Compton\", but you can't return, you ain't heard?\nBrothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs\nMob on to this new era, 'cause we untouchable\nStill can't believe that you got Pac rushing you\nUp in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed\nWho can you trust? Only time reveals\nToss it up\n\nOn and on, yeah, and on\nLet me see you toss it up (Toss it up)\nWon't you toss it up (Yeah, no doubt)\nWon't you toss it up, yeah (Let me see you toss it up)\nPlay on player, play on\nYeah (Let me see you toss it up)\nLet me see you toss it up\nHow can some non-players do a song about tossing it up\nAnd then want to do a player song?\n(You so fat, you and Lil' Kim need a weight scale to lay down in bed\nWe are not little kids, you fat ass, you feelin' threatened)\nHow can non-players do it? (You know who I'm talking bout)\nTeddy Riley, who? Puffy? who?\nPuffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon\nYou still ain't touching us, all that peace talk\nI don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street, boy\nIt's on! Toss it up, we took you on\nAnd we took y'all beat (Toss it up)\nYou know who beat we took, and we took y'all beat\n'Cause you wasn't rocking it right! (Toss it up now)\nTired of suckers rocking beats that don't belong to them, toss it up, it's on, it's out there now, it's our beat now\nYeah, toss it up now!13Embed"

(What's wrong, nigga?)\n\nThey wanna bury me, I'm worried\nI'm losin' my mind Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry\nFallin' to pieces, am I guilty?\nI pray to the Lord but he ignores me, unfortunately, \u2018cause I'm guilty\nShow me a miracle, I'm hopeless, I'm chokin' off marijuana smoke\nWith every toke, it's like, I'm losin' focus\nFallin' asleep while I'm in service, when will I die?\nForever paranoid and nervous because I'm high\nDon't mention funerals, I'm stressin' and goin' nutty and reminiscin' 'bout them niggas that murdered my buddy\nI wonder: When will I be happy?\nAin't nothin' funny, flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money\nWhere am I goin'? I discovered, can't nothin' save me\nMy next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers\nPut a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it\nHappy birthday, bitch, you know you shouldn't have did it\nEverybody's dyin', am I next? Who can I trust?\nWill they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?\nOr will they kill me while I'm sleepin'?\nTwo to the head, while I'm in bed leakin' blood on my satin sheets\nIs there a heaven for a baller?\nI'm gettin' suspicious of this bitch, the line's busy, every time I call her\nNow she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?\nI check the house before I bone, so we all alone\nAfter I nut, I hit the highway, see ya later!\nTo all the players, watch the fly way a nigga played her\nThis bitch is tellin' all her homies that I can fuck her like no other\nNow them other bitches wanna bone me\nI'm under pressure, gettin' drunk, somebody help me\nI drank a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy\nI see my enemies, they creepin', don't make me blast\nI watch the 5-0's roll, the motherfuckers pass\nBy me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh\nI put up my middle finger, then I dash\nNiggas don't like me, \u2018cause I'm thuggin'\nAnd every day, I'm a hustler, lookin' to get paid\nThey wanna bury me, I'm worried\u2014no need to lie\nI pray to God, I don't scream, when it's time to fry\nNowhere to rest, I'm losin' homies\u2014ain't that a bitch?\nWhen I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely\nI put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer\nI see visions of me dead, Lord, are you there?\nThen tell me, am I lost? \u2018Cause I'm lonely\nI thought I had friends, but in the end a nigga dies lonely\nNowhere to run, I'm in terror and no one cares\nA closed casket at my funeral and no one's there\nIs there a future for a killer? I change my ways\nBut still that don't promise me, the next day\nSo I stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'\nI'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness\nThey wonder, if I'm hellbound\nWell, Hell can't be worse than this, 'cause I'm in Hell now\nDon't make me hurt you, I don't want to, but I will\nSeen motherfuckers killed over phone bills\nNever will I die, I'll be back\nReincarnated as a motherfuckin' MAC\n-11, 'cause in heaven, there's no shortage on G's\nI'm tellin' you now: ''You motherfuckers don't know me''\nYou might also like\nOnly fear of death\u2014 (You ghetto niggas)\nOnly fear of death is comin' back reincarnated\nOnly fear of death\u2014 (You ghetto niggas)\nOnly fear of death is comin' back reincarnated\n(I ain't scared to die)\nOnly fear of death\u2014 (You ghetto niggas)\nOnly fear of death is comin' back reincarnated\nOnly fear of death\u2014 (You ghetto niggas)\n(I ain't scared to die)\nOnly fear of death is comin' back reincarnated\nOnly fear of death\u2014 (You ghetto niggas)\nOnly fear of death is comin' back reincarnated\nOnly fear of death is\u2014 (You ghetto niggas)\n(Only fear of death)\nOnly fear of death is comin' back reincarnated\nOnly fear of death\u2014\nYou ghetto niggas\nYou ghetto niggas\nYou ghetto niggas\nYou ghetto niggas\nYou ghetto niggas\nYou ghetto niggas\n\nI ain't scared to die\n(You ghetto niggas)\nDo you wanna live forever?\n(You ghetto niggas)\nAre you scared to die?\nOr will you scream when you fry?\nMy only fear of death\nMy only fear of death, is comin' back, reincarnated\nThis is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P. and Big Kato, R.I.P.\u00a0\nAnd all you other O.G.'s who goes down; my only fear of death8Embed"

It's a shame because the man's slain\nHe got caught in the chains of his own game\nHow can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?\nSweated me, hunted me, trapped in my own community\nOne day I'm gonna bust, blow up on this society\nWhy did you lie to me? I couldn't find a trace of equality\nWorked me like a slave while they laid back\nHomie don't play that, it's time I let 'em suffer the payback\nI'm tryin' to avoid physical contact\nI can't hold back, it's time to attack, Jack\n\nThey got me trapped\nUh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down\nYou know they got me trapped\nNah, they can't keep the Black man down\nTrapped\nUh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down\nThey got me trapped\nNah, they can't keep the Black man down\nNow I'm trapped and walkin' for my getaway\nAll I need is a G and somewhere safe to stay\nCan't use the phone 'cause I'm sure someone's tapping in\nDid it before, ain't scared to use my gat again\nI look back in hindsight, the fight was irrelevant\nBut now he's the Devil's friend, too late to be tellin' him\nHe shot first and I'll be damned if I run away\nHomie is done away, I should've put my gun away\nI wasn't thinkin', all I heard was the ridicule\nGirlies was laughin', Tup saying, \"Damn, homie's dissin' you\"\nFired my weapon, started steppin' in the hurricane\nI got shot, so I dropped feelin' a burst of pain\nGot to my feet, couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood\nNow I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer\nRan through an alley, still lookin' for my getaway\nCopper say, \"Freeze, or you'll be dead today\"\nTrapped in a corner, dark and I couldn't see the light\nThoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life\nWhat do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?\nI'd rather die than be trapped in a living Hell\n\nThey got me trapped\nUh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down\nThey got me trapped\nNah, they can't keep the Black man down\nTrapped\nUh-uh, they can't keep the Black man down\nYou know they got me trapped\nNah, they can't keep the Black man down\nTrapped\nYo, y'all seen 2Pac, man? Y'all seen 2Pac, man?\nThere he go! Ayy 'Pac, ayy, rollers out here, Pac, we gon' bail\nLet's go, man...23Embed"

In fact, who's the blackjack?\nSit back and get fat off the fat cat\nWhile he thinks that he's gettin' over\nI bust a move as smooth as Casanova\nAnd count another quick mill'\nI'm getting paid for my trade, but I'm still real\nAnd if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme\nAs strong as a fuckin' nine\nMail stacked up, niggas wanna act up\nLet's put the gats up and throw your blacks up\nBut the cops getting dropped by the gunshot\nUsed to come but he's done, now we run the block\nTo my brothers, stay strong, keep your heads up\nThey know we fed up\nBut they just don't give a fuck\nYeah, they just don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck either, man)\nI gotta give my fuck offs\nFuck you to the San Francisco Police Department\nFuck you to the Marin County Sheriff's Department\nFuck you to the FBI\nFuck you to the CIA\nFuck you to the B-U-S-H\nFuck you to the Ameri-K-K-Ka\nFuck you to all you redneck prejudice motherfuckers\nThat wanna fuck with me, fuck y'all\nPunk gay insensitive little dick bastards\n2Pacalypse motherfuckerin' now\nY'all can all kiss my ass and suck my dick\nAnd my Uncle Tommy's balls\nFuck y'all\nPunks26Embed"

Am I fallin' off?\nI hit the weed and then proceed to say, \"Fuck all of y'all!\"\nAin't nobody down with me, I'm thuggin'\nI can't go home, 'cause muh'fuckers think I'm buggin'\nSo now I'm in this high-powered cell at the county jail\nPunk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail\nWhat do I do in these county blues?\nGettin' battered and bruised by the you-know-who\nAnd these fakes get to shakin' when they face me\nSnakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me\nSittin' in this livin' hell, listenin' to niggas yell\nTryin' to torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' mail\nBut ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts\nIs makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked\nThey violated my probation\nAnd it seems I'll be goin' on a long vacation\nMeanwhile, it ain't easy\u2014\nNo, it ain't easy\nIt ain't easy bein' me\nWill I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?\nIt ain't easy bein' me\nWill I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?\nIt ain't easy bein' me\nWill I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?\nIt ain't easy bein' me\nWill I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?\nIt ain't easy bein' me\nWill I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?\nIt ain't easy bein' me\nWill I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?25Embed"

All these motherfuckers stole from me\nI'm taking back what's mine\n\nYou motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)\nEven if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem\nDo you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?\nReal live black... ghosts\nFeel me?\n\nSome say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me\nMama tried to raise me, but had too many babies\nPapa was a motherfucking joke\nUsed to find dope in his coat and nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke\nDaaamn, don't get me started\nMy mama smoked so goddamn much\nWhen she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded\nAt night I can't sleep, count sheep\nAs they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep\nStaring at the wall, heard a scream\nWake up in the mornin', see the blood in the hall from the murder scene\nDon't cry, just ask why, and try not to die\nAs I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby\nOn the corner, where the niggas slang their crack\nAnd the undercovers jack those that don't watch their back\n(Five-0) I daydream about the dope world\nTake a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl\nMy mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug\nSnatchin drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs\n(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath, every step could be death 'til you blast\nAnd be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost\nYou might also like\nDon't cry, just ask why, and try not to die\nAs I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby\nDon't cry, just ask why, and try not to die\nAs I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby\n\nA seven-deuce full of niggas goes by\nThought I was trippin' the second time they rolled by\nRecognized the plates, the faces looked familiar\nEverybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna kill ya\nDon't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep\nLet me die as I rest in peace, deep\nBack to these niggas in the seven-deuce\nA Mac-10 out the window 'bout to let it loose\nWhat could I do? Run for cover and return fire\nDIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why\nBut I let off everything I have\nAn empty clip hit the ground as a nigga dash\nOn my ass was the motherfuckin cops now\nBarely breathin tryna keep from gettin shot down\nBOO-YAOW was the sound, bullet whizzed by\nStill running like a nigga got nine lives\nDon't know why but I'm running to my fucking block\nTook a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops\nTime to be a ghost\n(Hey man, come the fuck on)\nAnd then we'll be ghost\nDon't cry, just ask why, and try not to die\nAs I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby\nFUCK THE POLICE NIGGA!27Embed"

I'm your homie that was down to brawl\nSippin' Hennessy, hangin' with the clowns, and all\nWe used to do is drink brew, screw and common knew\nWe had bitches by the dozens, huh, we fuckin' cousins\nYou can throw your middle finger if you feel me, Loc\nA nigga just got paid and we still was broke\nIt took time, but finally, the cash was mine\nAll the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind\nLook around, and all I see is snakes and fakes\nIt's like scavengers, waitin' to take a hustler's place\nAnd when you stuck, where the fuck is all your friends?\nThey straight busted and can't be trusted, fuck y'all\n\nYeah, that's right\nI thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends (Fuck all y'all)\nI thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends (Fuck all y'all)\nI thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends\nYou might also like\nI'm sippin' Tanqueray and juice, and what's the use?\n\u2018Cause I'm a hopeless thug\nAin't no love, reminiscin' on how close we was\nWay back in the day, before they put the crack in the way\nAnd hey, how much money can you stack in a day?\nIt's gettin' rough, collect calls from my niggas in cuffs\nI recollect we used to ball, now just living's enough\nI stand tall in the winter, summer, spring or fall\n\"Thug For Life\" sprawled all across the wall\nAnd all about my dollars make me wanna holla'\nDrop an album, sell a million, give a fuck about tomorrow\nI know, it's gettin' crazy after dark, these marks\nKeep on huffin' and puffin', ain't no fear in my heart\nWhat's goin' on in the ghetto? Still struggle and strive\nI still roll with the heater, smokin' Chocolate Thai\nIn '94, I'll be goin' solo\nToo many problems of my own so I'm rollin' dolo, fuck all y'all\n\nHuh, pardon me\nI thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends (That's right, fuck all y'all)\nI thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends (Fuck all y'all)\nFuck all y'all\nI thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends\nI went from rags to riches\nQuick to socializin' with the baddest bitches\nWent from a bucket to a rag with switches\nI'm seein' death around the corner\nI'm bumpin' \"Gloria,\" doin' 90 \u2018cause I wanna\nI'm gettin' high, and like I said, it was some Chocolate Thai\nMixed with some Indonesia, watch me fly\nAnd even though I know the cops behind me (Haha!)\nHit the weed and I continue doin' 90 (Biatch!)\nUntil I get caught, another ticket get to kick it in court\nFuck the law, give a shit, I'm even worse than before\nI know they wanna see a nigga buried\nBut I ain't worried, still throwin' these thangs\nGot me locked in these chains\nAnd hey, nigga, what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout?\nSoon as I hit the cell, I'll be bailin' out\nAnd when I hit the streets, I'm in a rush to ball\nI'm screamin' \"Thug Life!\", nigga, fuck y'all (I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends)\n\nThat\u2019s right, fuck all y'all man (I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends)\nFuck all y\u2019all\nThat is right, I don\u2019t need nobody (I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends)\nFuck all y\u2019all\nFuck all the hard copies daily news (I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends)\nFuck the bitches, the tele news, New York Posts, all those motherfuckers (I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends)\nFuck all y\u2019all\nFuck 'em\nI thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends\nI thought I had friends, but I ain't got no\u201410Embed"

Where do niggas go when we die?\nAin't no heaven for a thug nigga\nThat's why we go to thug mansion\nThat's the only place where thugs get in free\nAnd you gotta be a G, at thug mansion\nA place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind\nSo much pressure in this life of mine\nI cry at times, I once contemplated suicide\nAnd would've tried, but when I held that 9\nAll I could see was my mama's eyes\nNo one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble\nNot knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you\nPicture me inside the misery of poverty\nNo man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived\nPrayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on\nMe and my dogs ain't have a choice but to roll on\nWe found a family spot to kick it\nWhere we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit\nA spot where we can smoke in peace and even though we G's\nWe still visualize places that we can roll in peace\nAnd in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go and pass it\nI got a spot for us all so we can ball at thug's mansion\nYou might also like\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, \u2018cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)\nNothing but peace, love\nAnd street passion (I wanna go, nigga)\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\n\nA place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide\nNot to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by\nNo policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets\nNo reason for nobody's mama to cry\nSee, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter\nBut if I should die, I know all of my albums support her\nThis whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me\nOnly difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe\n\u2018Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'\nI'm just 20-some-odd years, I done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy\nI know she smiles on her boy\nI dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur\n\u2018Cause, like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war\nAnd just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more\n\u2018Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne\nWhere angels soar with golden wings, in thug's mansion\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, \u2018cause it's all good (at thugs's mansion)\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\nDear mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good\nTell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods\nSeen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook\nDrinkin' peppermint Schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke\nThen some lady named Billie Holiday sang\nSittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came\nLittle Latasha sure grown\nTell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home\nMaybe in time you'll understand only God can save us\nWhen Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band\nJust think of all the people that you knew in the past\nThat passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last\nPicture a place that they exist together\nThere has to be a place better than this in Heaven\nSo right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'\nRemember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\n(At thugs's mansion)\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, \u2018cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion9Embed"

Well, I ain't prejudiced\nI don't give a fuck\nThis is what it sounds like\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nBiatch! When we ride on our enemies\n\nHey, got some static for some niggas on the other side of town\nLet my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now\nWhat they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?\nUsed to love niggas, now I plug niggas, and slug niggas\nAm I wrong? Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us\nMust be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust\nTo the chest I bust, then we ride 'til the sun come\nShinin' back to brighten up the sky; how many die?\nHeard the Fugees was tryin' to do me\nLook, bitch, I'll cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie\nThen, we watch the other two die slow\nCastrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow\nBam! Set my plan in mo'\nTime to exterminate my foes, I can't stand you hoes\nUh, now label this my fuckin' trick shot\nMy lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nYou might also like\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nI bet you motherfuckers die\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nBet all you motherfuckers die\nWhen we ride on our enemies\n\nCome take a journey through my mind's eye\nYou crossed the game, don't explain, nigga, time to die\nSay goodbye, watch my eyes when I pull the trigger\nSo right before you die, you bow before a bigger nigga\nNow dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits\nNiggas love to scream \"peace\" after they start some shit\nPay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me\nI murder you, then I run a train on Mobb Deep!\nDon't fuck with me, nigga, you're barely livin'; don't you got sickle cell?\nSee me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well\nHell, how many niggas wanna be involved?\nSee, I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill all of y'all, then ball\nThen tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed\nFuck around and get tossed up by the fuckin' Outlawz\nBefore I leave, make sure everybody heard\nKnow I meant every motherfuckin' word\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nMake sure everybody die\nWhen we ride, on our enemies\nWhen we ride on our enemies, hehe\nI make sure everybody die\nWhen we ride, on our enemies14Embed"

Comin' down!\"\nThe political prisoners, San Quentin\n\u201cLook at Satan\u201d \u201cI see him\u201d\nAll the jailhouses, I'm witchu\n\nYeah, one thug, one thug\nHow do we keep the music playin'?\nYou're listenin' to the sounds of one thug\nOne thug, one thug, How do we get ahead?\nYou're listenin' to the sounds of\u2026\n\nI wake up early in the mornin', mind state so military\nSuckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried\nWas it me, the weed or this life I lead?\nIf daytime is for suckers then tonight we breathe\nOut for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks\nLook how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps\nMeet me at the cemetery, dressed in black\nTonight we honor the dead, those who won't be back\nSo, if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears\nAn outlaw thug livin' in this game for years\nWhy worry? Hope to God, get me high when I'm buried\nKnowin' deep inside only a few love me\nDon't rush me to the gates of Heaven\nLet me picture for a while, how I lived for my days as a child\nI wonder now, how do we outlast?\nAlways get cash, stay strong if we all mash; hold ya head!\nYou might also like\nHow do we keep the music playin'?\nYes, you got to hold ya head!\nHow do we get ahead? Hold ya head!\nToo many young black brothers are dyin'\nYes, you got to hold ya head!\nLivin' fast, too fast\n\nThese felonies be like prophecies\nBeggin' me to stop \u2018cause these\nLawyers gettin' money every time they knock us\nSnatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flee when they notice\nSwitched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost\nExposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows, they froze\nNow suckers idolize my chosen blows\nAnd mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'\nGot a cell at the pen' for me waitin'\u2014is this my fate?\nMiss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back?\nNever that, too much Tequila drinkin', we all that\nMake them understand me? Hell nah, this ain't my posse\nEveryone with me is family, \u2018cause everybody's got me\nWatch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'\nGot us all meetin' up in prison\nLast week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood\nSayin', \"Please show a playa love\"\u2014hold ya head!

I put my soul in the song\nTo help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone\nWe went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches\nWe went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches\nBut somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange\nLost all my homies over cocaine, man\nSee, they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie\nSee, you gotta get high or die, \u2018cause even thugs cry\nOh, why should you send your child off to die?\nIn the streets of chalk where they lie\nLet no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God\nOh my, does it have to be this way?\nOur children of today won't stay wise\nLet the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?\n\nAnd all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures\nBustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures\n\u2018Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don\nI write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone\nWhy perpetrate like you can handle my team?\nSo merciless in my attack I take command of your dreams\nLeavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood\nClownin', takin' pictures later\nLaugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches\nRegulate my area, the terror I represent\nMakin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went\nAm I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?\nAddicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told\nCome take my body, God, don't let me suffer any longer!\nSmoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long\nWhere is the end to all my misery, is there a close?\nI suppose that's why I murder my foes\nWhen thugs cry\nOh, why should you send your child off to die?\nIn the streets of chalk where they lie\nLet no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God\nOh my, does it have to be this way?\nOur children of today won't stay wise\nLet the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?\nOh, why should you send your child off to die?\nIn the streets of chalk where they lie\nLet no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God\nOh my, does it have to be this way?\nOur children of today won't stay wise\nLet the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?\n\nI shed tattooed tears for years\nFor my dead homeboys and my prison peers\nY'all ain't never heard my cries\nNow you wonder why would you die?\n\nAyy Nas, remember that shit you said? I don't know what magazine you said it on... Some shit about we're sending thugs to whoever & whenever. You need to go to the record store and check out some of the albums you've been putting out, because you been spitting this thug shit for a while now.

Somebody else's child\nCaught in gun smoke and we, can all make a change\nSo I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold\nI'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe\nCommunities in need of people that will lead\nKeep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try\nUntil the day I die, I promise to be wise\nWith my heart open, greed brings only misery\nA way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free\nOnly a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise\nDon't be afraid to try, too many of us die\nFor the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise\nStay focused on the prize, though everybody dies\n\nWe can only learn to take, our anger and our hate\nControl our mental states, settle down and set it straight\nMaybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes\nBefore we said it, regret it later and let it escalate\n\u2018Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take\nAnd there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate\nTo the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes\nYou think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes\nBut we ain't, its grain to go against\nWith every artist comes the image he portrays\nAnd the picture that he paints\nBut in the midst of all this anger and this angst\nNever once did you hear me say I'm a gangster\nAnd I ain't hear no complaints\nBut I know that I will always continue to grow\nAs long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow\nThere will never be another me, and that I can guarantee\nThat's why the fuck I remain sucker free\nTo this day, the game will never be the same\nNo matter how much fame and success they attain\nThere will never be another me\nAnd no matter what they do, there will never be another you\nYou can search, but you'll never find\nYou can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds\nWe will never die, we are forever alive\nAnd we continue growin', one day at a time\nYou might also like\nDon't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype\nRappers are regular people minus money and lights\nSearchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom\nAll the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest\nThere's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'\nAnd the kids think beef is they only option\nOutlawz born filthy, guilty as charged\nMy memories of Kadaf' while Makaveli lives on\nYou think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns\nAnd when your money is up, that's when your enemies come\nSo if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?\nWe needin' a change, the drama remains the same\n\nI spend my whole life fightin' myself\nThat I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help\nAnd every now and then, I take rights from the left\nI'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt\nYeah, and that there is a fight in itself\nSo I just pray and hope God, take a like to myself\nNo matter how much I try to stay alive\nI'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride\n\nHeard frivolous beats, we past that\nI'm tryin' to keep some income coming in\nAnd collect on my ASCAP\nThe rappers in the game ain't changed (No)\nAnd I finally realize that we're not in the same game\nThe hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it\nThem .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it\nThe streets is military, you gotta be a soldier\nGotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers\nThey do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us\nSo we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'\nOne way at a time, keep the faith in your mind\nAnd we continue growin', one day at a time, damn17Embed"

Please\nLincoln just said that to save the nation\nThese are lies that we all accepted\nSay no to drugs, but the governments' kept it\nRunning through our community, killing the unity\nThe war on drugs is a war on you and me\nAnd yet, they say this is the home of the free\nYou ask me, it's all about hypocrisy\nThe constitution, yo, it don't apply to me\nAnd Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me\nThis may be strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin'\nBut its wrong to keep someone from learning something\nSo get up, its time to start nation building\nI'm fed up, we gotta start teaching children\nThat they can be all that they want to be\nThere's much more to life than just poverty\nThis is definitely, uh, words of wisdom\nYou might also like\nAmerica! America! AmeriKa-Ka-Ka\nI charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault\nFor suppressing and punishing my people\nI charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history\nI charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me trapped in the projects\nAnd the jury finds you guilty on all accounts\nAnd you are to serve the consequences for your evil schemes\nProsecutor, do you have any more evidence?\n\nWords of wisdom based upon the strength of a nation\nConquer the enemy armed with education\nProtect yourself, reach for what you want to do\nKnow thyself, teach by what we've been through\nArmed with the knowledge of the place we've been\nNo one will ever oppress this race again\nNo Malcolm X in my history text, why's that?\n\u2019Cause he tried to educate and liberate all Blacks\nWhy is Martin Luther King in my book each week?\nHe told Blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek\nI don't get it, so many questions went through my mind\nI get sweated, they act like asking questions a crime\nBut forget it, 'cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong\nNot every brother had his mother on the welfare line\nThe American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable\nThey're pulling your sleeve, don't believe, \u2019cause it'll strangle ya\nPulling the life of your brain, I can't explain\nBeg as you can obtain from which you came\nYou swear to your mother that you living in equality\nForgetting your brother that's living here in poverty\nThought they had us beaten when they took out King\nBut the battle ain't over 'til the Black man sings\nWords of wisdom\nThe battle ain't over 'till the Black man sings, words of wisdom\nNightmare! That's what I am\nAmerica's nightmare\nI am what you made me\nThe hate and the evil that you gave me\nI shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people for four hundred plus years\nYou should be scared, you should be running\nYou should be trying to silence me\nHa, but you can not escape fate\nFor it is my turn to come\nJust as you rose, you will fall\nBy my hands\nAmerica, you reap what you sow\n2Pacalypse, America's nightmare\nIce Cube and Da Lench Mob, America's nightmare\nAbove The Law, America's nightmare\nParis, America's nightmare\nPublic Enemy, America's nightmare\nKRS-One, America's nightmare\nNew Afrikan Panthers, America's nightmare\nMutulu Shakur, America's nightmare\nGeronimo Pratt, America's nightmare\nAssata Shakur, America's nightmare\nEt cetera, et cetera, et cetera17Embed"

I.. I'm goin' for it.. I'm tryin' for it\nAnd until then..I have to make the life that I do live\nAs happy as I can and try to do the best with what I have\nDo.. you know, live the best life I can live\nBe as happy as I can be.. nothing is perfect for anybody\nI don't think\nThug for life, feel me? (that's right)\nI know it seems hard sometimes, but..\nRemember one thing..\nTo every dark night, there's a bright day after that\nAll my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong\nWhen things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth\nSo no matter how hard it get, stick you chest out, keep your head up..\nAnd handle it!\nHold on..\nI'll catch y'all up in the next life\nWe're in traffic\nAy do this Thug style main, Thug style\nWhen this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to 'em bet\nIt's all good, uhh\nYou might also like\nI never had much, ran with a bad bunch\nLittle skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch\nAnd all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by\nAnd driveby's robbed my homies of their young lives\nI never did cry, and even though I had\nPain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start\nThey couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me\nThe marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy\nI travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year\nI felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here\nNever did like the police, let the whole world know\nNow I gets no peace, cause they chasin' me down\nAnd facing me now, what do I do?\nThese thangs that a Thug goes through\nAnd still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong\nIt's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on\n\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on\nThere's, never a good day, cause in my hood they\nLet they AK's pump strays where the kids play\nAnd every Halloween, check out the murder scene\nCan't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen\nMy homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays\nThese is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray\nAnd even God turned his back on the ghetto youth\nI know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof\nI wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does\nDoes it matter if you blood or you cuz\nRemember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects\nSmall time drinkin' getting high with them armies\nJust another knucklehead kid from the gutter\nI'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother\nI'm tryin' to tell you when it's on\nYou gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on\n\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on\nI know them ain't tears coming down your face\nWhen it's on it's on but wipe your eyes\nIn this world only the strong survive y'know\nHmm, I know it's hard out there\nWelfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, carjackings\nYeah we got problems but believe me when I tell you\nThings always get better God don't like ugly\nAnd God don't like no quitters\nYou know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee\nGod bless the child that can hold his own\nY'know? You got to stand strong\nAnd when these busters try to knock you out your place\nYou stand there to they face tell em hold on, and be strong\nThe game don't stop, Hmmm\nHold on, and be strong, this here is Black Man\n\nIf you don't never leave nothin', learn one thing\nIt don't stop, til the casket drop\nHold on6Embed"

Don't be alarmed, death to all strangers\nMaybe I'm a madman\nA pistol grabbin' nigga, unleash the Sandman\nPromise a merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder\nClose your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier\n\nThug for Life, I will be\nThis is the ballad of a dead soldier\nA life of crime I will lead\nClose your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier\nIf you play the game, you play to win\nThis is the ballad of a dead soldier\nIt's a crazy world full of sin\nClose your eyes\nYou might also like\nCompletely lost, revenge at all costs\nPayback's a bitch, switched, now the trick's crossed\nTossed up and never to be heard of\nA single witness screaming, \"Bloody murder, murder!\"\nBlast, tell me, homie, what you see now?\nA blind man and a dead body, I'm ready to leave town\nAnd get my cash though, hook up with Kastro\nHomie, had to blast on the task force\nStupid coppers tried to play us out, never that\nThey took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back, haha\nUpon my secret arrival\nTwo Glock 45's, time for survival\nDeath to my rivals, tell me, what you want, Lord?\nNobody left after the death of a drug lord, haha\nThe situation's critical\nNothing is colder than hear the ballad of a dead soldier\n\nThug for Life, I will be\nThis is the ballad of a dead soldier\nA life of crime I will lead\nClose your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier\nIf you play the game, you play to win\nThis is the ballad of a dead soldier\nIt's a crazy world full of sin\nClose your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier\nBe a coward, put your hands to the Moon\nWhen my Glocks rang out, the niggas came out, \"Boom\"!\nWho wanna see me in a challenge?\nSo merciless, I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads\nDo you feel me? Capo or Captain\nOne day I'll be the Don, until then, remain strong\nMy only fear of death is reincarnation\nBustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient\nTo all my niggas facin' 60 years\nSheddin' tattooed tears, another suicidal on the tier\nTakin' private planes, tryna survive the game\nFor all my homies that'll never be alive again\nAll they promise us is death, nigga\nTake a breath, come be the last one left, nigga\nIt's real now, feel it or fantasize it, ain't nothing colder\nListen, you can hear it the ballad of a dead soldier\n\nThug for Life, I will be\nThis is the ballad of a dead soldier\nA life of crime I will lead\nClose your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier\nIf you play the game, you play to win\nThis is the ballad of a dead soldier\nIt's a crazy world full of sin\nClose your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier\nThis go out to Kato, Mental, all the niggas that passed away\nMutulu, Geronimo, Seyku, all the down-ass riders\nAll the niggas that put it down, all the soldiers\nAll the niggas that go through that day-to-day struggle\n(This is the ballad of a dead soldier!)\nAll the niggas that passed on\nAll the niggas with ambition and money in they heart\nAll the niggas that want some and that don't take none\nHahaha (It's the ballad of a dead soldier!)\nThe police are so scared of us\nAll the feds they aware of us\nThey wanna see us dead\nThey got pictures of a nigga head, (Ballad of a dead soldier!)\nTryin' to see me in chains, shit\nThem niggas'll never breathe again\nBefore they put me in a cell, they'll see me in Hell\n('Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!)\nGot my pistols cocked\nRun the whole motherfuckin' block, fuck the cops!\nThe police? We run these streets, nigga\nHuh (Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!)\nHeh, these niggas can't see me, half the world wanna be me\nMulti-millionaire, shit, it ain't fair\nBut, nigga, you know, it's the ballad of a dead soldier!3Embed"

Come on!\n\nOne thing we all adore\nSomething worth dyin' for\nNothin' but pain, stuck in this game\nSearchin' for fortune and fame\nThe one thing we all adore\nSomething worth dyin' for\nIt's been nothin' but pain, stuck in this game\nSearchin' for fortune and fame\n\nThough we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's\nStress is half the battle, with success comes greed\nThey got me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge\nTo increase my ends, enemies gettin' dropped\nWin or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true\nPlay the game, nigga, never let the game play you\nAnd for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame\nWhat's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?\nWho can I blame? The world seems strange at times\nSomewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time\nI'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse\nI know, death follows me, but I'll murder him first\nAnd worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless\nIs there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?\nCigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses\nWe mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask\nI'm the first one to want him blasted\nWrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit\nAin't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me\nNothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fake in fame\nYou might also like\nBlock run and shoot slugs\nWe throw them back like hardballs\nWithout the gloves, no love for these fake desperadoes\nAnd thugs I bleed to envy\nSmoke and blow out they blunts, sippin' Henny\nDrunk nights, and hot days\nCockin' my heat, shootin' it sideways\nA life on the run, full of common blunts\nUnconditionally married to my gun\nFulfillin' my destiny on knees and one's desires\nBe pullin' all my cabbage like priors, stuck in the trance\nSearchin' for something higher, the fortune and fame\n\nOne thing we all adore\nSomething worth dyin' for\nNothin' but pain, stuck in this game\nSearchin' for fortune and fame\nSomething we all adore\nSomething worth dyin' for\nIt's been nothin' but pain, stuck in this game\nSearchin' for fortune and fame\n\nSearchin' for fortune and fame, lost in the rain\nA lost of the game, with life is the cost of the game\nWe forcin' the change, motherfuck flossin' a chain\nAll the blame belongs to the part of the brain\nThat we never use, nigga, plus my heart is in pain\nAnd if I ever lose, homie, bet I'm at it again\nOutlaws don't die, so united we stand\nAnd if family come before, all the fortune and fame\nAs I walk up in the crib, laid to rest my head\nSay salaam to the angels, hope they bless my bed\nHope they bless me the righteous way\nGot a homie locked down outta town, I sent him a kite today\nMan, that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it, dawg\nPrayin' for my downfall, and I can sense it, dawg\nI was passed down the street fame\nLike Glocks clocked and keep aim\nWas raised up with a clock box\nAnd I ran with the local street gang\nThey say the light is faded but still shine in the dark\nYou can easy been a man, but you's a boy in your heart\nAnd that's some game that I got from generation of game\nIn the road of life, dog\nWe need to switch up lanes \u2013 think about it!\n\nOne thing we all adore\nSomething worth dyin' for\nNothin' but pain\nStuck in this game\nSearchin' for fortune and fame\nOne thing we all adore\nSomething worth dyin' for\nBeen nothin' but pain\nStuck in this game\nSearchin' for fortune and fame\nI can't complain, I've seen my fair share of the fame\nIt won't change me, now I've got this piece of change\nI feel strange, I got so used to the hood\nThat when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good\nI was just a baby, still retarded from slavery\nWhen we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me\nGhetto ain't made me, I made myself\nPoverty raised me, thinking ain't no help\nI pray for my health, my mind, and my family too\nState of myself, my grind, and my family crew\nWhere one hand washes the other\nNo, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers\nThe struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build\nAnd that remains the same 'til the day that we killed\nAnd that's real, life that I was aimed to be\nLove by my family tree, that's fame to me \u2013 how about it?\n\nOne thing we all adore\nSomething worth dyin' for\nNothin' but pain\nStuck in this game\nSearchin' for fortune and fame\nOne thing we all adore\nSomething worth dyin' for\nNothin' but pain\nStuck in this game\nSearchin' for fortune and fame10Embed"

He snitched and told a friend\nIt's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old-timers\nAnd fuck five-0! Blaow, blaow! Turn 'em into forty-niners\nYou might also like\nBye bye, I was never meant to live\nCan't be positive when the ghetto's where you live\nBye bye, I was never meant to be\nLivin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets\nBye bye, and I got no place to go\nWhere they find me; 16 on Death Row\n\nDear Mama, these cops don't understand me\nI turned to a life of crime \u2018cause I came from a broken family\nMy uncle used to touch me, I never told you that\nScared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back\nI kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger\nI'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger\nThe brother in my cell is 16 as well\nIt's hard to adapt when you're black\nAnd you're trapped in a living hell\nI shouldn't have let him catch me\nInstead of livin' sad in jail I coulda died free and happy\nAnd my cellmate's raped on the norm\nAnd passed around the dorm\nYou can hear his asshole gettin' torn\nThey made me an animal\nCan't sleep, instead of countin' sheep, niggas countin' cannibals\nAnd that's how it is in the pen\nTurn old and cold and your soul is your best friend\nMy mama, pray for me\nTell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me\n(Why?) \u2018Cause when they come for me they find a struggler\nTo the death I take the breath from your jugular\nThe trick is to never lose hope\nI found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope; 16 on Death Row\nBye bye, I was never meant to live\nCan't be positive when the ghetto's where you live\nBye bye, I was never meant to be\nLivin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets\nBye bye, and I got no place to go\nWhere they find me; 16 on Death Row\n\nDear Mama, they sentenced me to death\nToday's my final day, I'm countin' every breath\nI'm bitter \u2018cause I'm dyin', so much I haven't seen\nI know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at 16\nI got beef with a sick society\nThat doesn't give a shit and they too quick to say goodbye to me\nThey tell me the preacher's there for me\nHe's a crook with a book, that motherfucker never cared for me\nHe's only here to be sure\nI don't drop a dime to God about the crimes he's committin' on the poor\nAnd how can these people judge me?\nThey ain't my peers and in all these years they ain't never love me\nI never got to be a man\nMust be part of some big plan to keep a nigga in the state pen\nAnd to my homies out buryin' motherfuckers\nSteer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers\n\u2018Cause once they got you locked up\nThey got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up\nI'm convinced, self-defense is the way\nPlease stay strapped, pack a gat every day\nI wish I woulda known while I was out there\nNow I'm straight headin' for the chair\nBye bye, I was never meant to live\nCan't be positive when the ghetto's where you live\nBye bye, I was never meant to be\nLivin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets\nBye bye, and I got no place to go\nWhere they find me; 16 on Death Row\n\n16 on Death Row, Death Row\nDeath Row, Death Row\n16 on Death Row, Death Row, Death Row\nIt's to all my partners\nIn the penitentiaries; 16 on Death Row11Embed"
