  "plain": "Jacques Bermon Webster II (born April 30, 1991), popularly known as Travis Scott (previously stylized as Travi$ Scott) is an American rapper and producer from Missouri City, Texas, located within the Houston Metropolitan area. Scott began producing and releasing beats via Myspace at 16.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles after dropping out of The University of Texas at San Antonio following his sophomore year, adopting the name Travi$ Scott in homage to his uncle named Travis, and his musical idol Kid Cudi (real name Scott Mescudi).\n\nTravis Scott dropped out of the University of Texas at San Antonio without his parents knowing and moved to Los Angeles to make music. His parents made a surprise visit to see their son at his former university. They eventually found out that he lied to them. They cut off support towards him from that time on. He ended up sleeping on couches and lived miles away from people he knew.\n\nWith some help of fellow southern rapper T.I., Scott signed to Epic Records and T.I.\u2019s label, Grand Hustle. After, he acquired the number of Kanye West\u2019s engineer, Anthony Kilhoffer. With Anthony\u2019s help, Scott was able to co-produce tracks on G.O.O.D. Music\u2019s debut album Cruel Summer. After his appearance on the label\u2019s album, Travis signed to G.O.O.D. Music under a producer contract and along with West\u2019s help, he released his debut solo mixtape Owl Pharaoh.\n\nHe released Days Before Rodeo on August 18, 2014, anticipating the release of his debut album entitled Rodeo, which was released September 4th, 2015.\n\nScott released his highly anticipated sophomore album Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight on September 2, 2016, after previewing it the same morning on the .WAV Radio show on Apple\u2019s Beats 1 platform. The album was an Apple Exclusive and was available exclusively on Apple Music for a week before its full rollout on all other marketplaces and streaming services.\n\nTravis' third studio album ASTROWORLD was released on August 3rd, 2018. The album was a critical and commercial success, selling half a million copies in its first week, and peaking at #1 on the US Billboard 200 chart.\n\nLa Flame is also the CEO of Cactus Jack Records, a record label that counts Sheck Wes, Don Toliver, SoFaygo, Luxury Tax 50 and Chase B on its roster.\n\nOn July 28, 2023, Travis' highly anticipated fourth full-length studio album, UTOPIA was released after an almost five-year wait from ASTROWORLD. The album was released alongside the Bad Bunny and The Weeknd-accompanied hit single, \u201cK-POP.\u201d The album shares several similarities to Kanye West\u2019s \u2014 a producer on the album \u2014 June 2013, Yeezus which Travis acted as producer on."

Who do I owe? Nigga, no one\nThey pickin' you up, but you low down, animated actin' frozen\nI got porno pics, wish I can post them, stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em\nNiggas askin' for the old him, but I'm way too young to be the old him\nI'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom 'til I climb to the top of the podium\n\nSo wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga\nNiggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga\nI'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic\nI might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish\n\nWe gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world\nWe gon' rule the world, hmm\n(Never gonna stop, never gonna stop, never ever gonna stop it)\nLa Flame says, \"Let your ambition carry you\"112Embed"

Wasted at night\n\nTake a sip, drownin' in this shit, coppers on my hip, I hold my head\nI been takin' risks to make that money flip, shots to the head\nI ain't order it, I can't afford this shit, go to war with this, you overboard, I'm over-bored with shit\nNow, it's pay a player, pay a nigga, got a day-to-day to stack and still, I pay accountants\nTwenty racks to show just a little allowance, only come to Houston if the boy allow it\nBow your head to a real one, comin' down with them main niggas\nH-Town, don't play with us, them with-it boys stay with-with-with it\nI been grindin', slavin' over time since I was a fan\nLookin' in the mirror like \"One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man\"\nOne skinny, tatted nigga, blunt flicker, young La Flame, hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yeah\nIt's really goin' down in the goddamn South\nI'm trill, I'm country 'til the end\nIt-it-it-it's really goin' down in the goddamn South\nI'm trill, I'm country 'til the end\n\nThere's a lot of motherfuckers that can't handle they liquor, can't handle these drugs (Wasted or nah?)\nIt's only real niggas that can handle their shit, man (Wasted or nah?), yeah (Wasted or nah?)\nSo if you tryna get lit, wanna pour up?\nMake sure you stay on our level, 'cause we go up, let me see you up\nSee Travis Scott LiveGet tickets as low as $248You might also like\nIs you wasted, baby? One shot, two shots and you still talkin' crazy (Trippy)\nThree shots and you faded, freaks comin' out at night and they gettin' X-rated\nFour shots now, she wanna do the clique, any more shots, she ain't gon' remember shit\nSmokin' on extendos, no clips, project hoes goin' up in the Ritz (Trippy)\nShe gon' do it for a G, anything for me, bruh, she just wanna fuck and drink and chief all the weed up\nSexy bitch, pop that pussy 'cause you in your prime, pour that purple over ice, call it \"turtle time\"\nShawty never been a hesitator, got her goin' down on the elevator\nHeard the pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her, fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later\nNo magic trick, but I levitate her, with the magic stick, nothin' less than great\nWhen I hit her with the dope D, I'm gone, don't text me later, no extra favors\nIt's really goin' down in the goddamn South\nI'm trill, I'm country 'til the end\nIt-it-it-it's really goin' down in the goddamn South\nI'm trill, I'm country 'til the end\n\nHmm, weed, lean, MDMA, he say, she say\nAll the products of a young man gone the long way\nFrom the home that he known, 'til he roamed where he at\nAnd the phone break up, unknown wake up\nSeveral one-night-stands, hung up phone, break up\nIf he fall, will he fly? Sure, it wouldn't take much\nFor you to find out, jump, have you took that plunge?\nIf not in the same spot, how could you judge?\n(H-h-how could you judge? C-c-could you judge?)53Embed"
