  "plain": "The Chicago born Wasalu Muhammad Jaco first tasted success when he featured on Kanye West\u2019s hit \u201cTouch the Sky\u201d, a track that shortly preceded his real breakout, his 2006 debut album Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Food & Liquor, and he never looked back. He has established himself as one of the greatest urban wordsmiths of all time, with Genius even dubbing him the \u2018Proust of Rap\u2019.\n\nWhile he\u2019s now regarded of one of the 21st Century\u2019s Hip-Hop greats, he wasn\u2019t always a fan of the genre, initially disliking it due to the prominence of vulgarity and misogyny within it. In his late teens, he aspired to make it as a lyricist. In his early twenty\u2019s, he met Jay-Z, who helped him sign with Atlantic Records in 2005. The following year, he released his debut album (Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Food & Liquor), which was met with acclaim from fans and critics alike, as did his sophomore effort, Lupe Fiasco\u2019s The Cool.\n\nThe following eight years of his career saw far less output than many would\u2019ve anticipated. This can be partly attributed to his struggles with Atlantic Records. The executives wanted him to sign a 360 deal; however, as he refused to do so they instead shelved his already completed 3rd album, Lasers, and wouldn\u2019t promote him as they had previously. The overseers at the label also interfered with his music (as they had tried to do with his fan-favorite track \u201cDumb it Down\u201d); subsequently effecting the quality and sound of his third and fourth albums.\n\nHowever, when it came to his fifth album, Tetsuo & Youth, he made no compromises, despite them again refusing to release his album, wanting to record a radio-friendly single for marketability. He released a promotional single preceding the album, but he stuck to his guns and made the album he wanted to make \u2014 and we at Genius are so glad he did.\n\nAfter leaving Atlantic, Lupe released his first full-length solo album, DROGAS WAVE, in late 2018. Although not meeting immediate success on the market due to a lack of marketing, the project was immediately met with love by both hardcore Lupe fans and objective lovers of lyricism and storytelling; seeing it as a return to form for Lupe after what many fans saw as a letdown in 2017\u2019s DROGAS Light."

Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it\nUnless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest\nBelieve all that, unless you Jewish\nLife is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus\nAnd I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris\nThe water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change\nMy chair position or conditions of my porridge\nSubmission for sedition against the religion of a chorus\nKeep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin' forest\nAs I perform a nerd storm, I prefer my pictures in word form\nBury the hatchet like how a bird born\nAs I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation\nHaving conversations with flavorful combinations\nSlave to my concentration\nSo that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands\nAnd two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood\nAnd, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks\nGiving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults\nRoad runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across\nAnomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir\nWildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor\nLevitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides\nBuckaroo roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides\nA thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes\nAnnouncing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies\nChocula Counts by the count of five\nRefrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters\nIncinerator chutes and the manual for Contra\nAssorted memories from my childhood\nAbsorbing energy from the wild woods\nElectronic combat Konami sign contract\nChinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact\nChicago, spray gun aficionado\nEfficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano\nWho\u2019s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano\nDudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo\nPolarize envy of the older guys\nBlack obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives\nSub-zero, Gaiden, hiding, Raiden in the pack as well\nSound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells\nDodging Rain and catching hail\nFaith seers need samurais to catch the L\nSpecial research vessels made for catching whales\nFilet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails\nRewrite history, liberty needs a better bell\nMaybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail\nSmarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale\nOr maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools\nTo announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school\nJust like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool\nCuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool\nYeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools\nSlipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel\nTechno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules\nWill have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood\nRoller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes\nOverweight taster of kings food that kills crews\nOblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu\nSimple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness\nReal Steel til' he realize his realness\nDefeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance\nYeah!\n341Embed\nWe're all chemicals, vitamins, and minerals\nAnd vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm\nTo see the vein like a chicken on the barn\nTop Cat chat, let's begin another yarn\nThat's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?\nBut roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy\nSo what powers cowards to get them to the top\nJust to fall asleep listening to Bach?\nThe ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop\nDribbling the eye across the prism of a clock\nThat lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading\nThey catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings\nNow what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?\nAnd what's the talking without the match feeling\nThat's buried living\nAnd cherry-picking every lemon from your berry system\nThen proceed with the pack feeding\nWhen I was young I had visions of another world\nSneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl\nIncense smoke made vortices and other curls\nCasting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls\nI like my pancakes cut in swirls\nMoroccan moles and undercover squirrels\nI like cartoons, southern cities with large moons\nFaith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms\nApologize for my weird mix\nWhat taste like hot dogs and tear drips?\nAnd looks like pantomime and clear bricks?\nAnd smells like shotguns and deer piss?\nThey on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard\nFirst part of a party, that I throw in parts\nOne minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts\nBut that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars\nI run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards\nFrom Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard\nPaint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes\nNerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake\nA word game back up plan that can dam lakes\nBackup the wordplay ain't playing that the man's states\nMeans I can still be the man if the dam breaks\nAnd when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face\nMy peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base\nThe unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine\nThat hovers above cities like weathermen\nOr maybe weather woman\nWhatever better to tell ya weather comin'\nI prefer girls to reign all over the world\nAnd not \u201crain\u201d like \u201cRain Man\u201d or rain like \u201crain dance\u201d\nOr rain like a \u201cslight chance of rain\u201d when it's rainin\u2019\nOr \u201crein\u201d like deer slaves to Santa Claus;

listening to the radio\nAnd a song comes on and a not far off from being born\nDoesn't know the difference between right and wrong\nNow, I ain't trying to make it too complex\nBut let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context\nAbout the perception of women these days\nHis mama sings along, and this what she says\n\"Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!\nSomethin' that's far above average.\"\nAnd maybe other rhyming words like \"cabbage\" and \"savage\"\nAnd \"baby carriage\" and other things that match it\nCouple of things are happenin' here\nFirst he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama, comma\nAnd because she's relatin' to herself\nAs most important source of help\nAnd mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor\nBitch bad, woman good\nLady better, they misunderstood\n(I'm killin' these bitches)\nUh, tell 'em, bitch bad\nWoman good, lady better\nThey misunderstood\nThey misunderstood\nYou might also like\nYeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through 12\nOn the Internet watching videos, listening to songs by themselves\nIt doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance\nThey understand the Internet better than their parents\nNow, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored\nThey're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored\nA complicated combination, maybe with no relevance\nUntil that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference\n\"Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches\nThat's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches.\"\nNow, let's say that they less concerned with him\nAnd more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims\nAh, the plot thickens: high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim\nReality check, I'm not trippin'\nThey don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch\nBitch bad, woman good\nLady better, they misunderstood\n(I'm killin' these bitches)\nI say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say\nBitch bad, woman good\nLady better, they misunderstood\n(I'm killin' these bitches)\nDisclaimer: this rhymer, Lupe, is not using \"bitch\" as a lesson\nBut as a psychological weapon\nTo set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions\nDiscretions, reflections, it's clever misdirection\n\u2018Cause while I was rappin' they was growin' up fast\nNobody stepped in to ever slow 'em up, gasp\nSho' enough, in this little world\nThe little boy meets one of those little girls\nAnd he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch\nHe thinks disrespectfully, she thinks of that sexually\nShe got the wrong idea, he don't wanna fuck her\nHe think she's bad at being a bitch like his mother\nMomma never dressed like that\nCome out the house, hot mess like that\nAss, titties, dressed like that, all out to impress like that\nJust like that, you see the fruit of the confusion\nHe caught in a reality, she caught in an illusion\n\"Bad\" mean good to her, she really nice and smart\nBut \"bad\" mean bad to him, \"bitch\" don't play a part\nBut \"bitch\" still bad to her if you say it the wrong way\nBut she think she a bitch \u2013 what a double entendre!\nTell 'em, bitch bad, woman good\nLady better, they misunderstood\nI say, I say, I say, I say, I say, I say\nBitch bad, woman good\nLady better, they misunderstood\nThey misunderstood\nBitch bad, woman good\nLady better, they misunderstood\nYou're

   "lyrics": "176 ContributorsAround My Way (Freedom Ain\u2019t Free) Lyrics\nYeah\nGreat American Rap, resurrect...\nRest in peace, Young F\n'Porting live from the set\nUh\n'Porting live from the set, yeah!\n\nFirst off, say \"Peace\" to Pine Ridge\nShame at all the damage that the white man wine did\nGhost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year\nAnd all that other crime did\nMore peace to the teachers of blind kids\nTo rebels in small cells keeping their mind big\nSay everything's hostile, suicide bombers\nAnd prosperity gospels, emaciated models\nWith cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils\nThey got to, just to stay awake\nOn the catwalk of life where everybody watch you\nStraight hair, high heels, and a handbag\nCrucifixes, racism, and a land grab\nKatrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags\nA peace sign and a pants sag\nA money toss cause a nine-stripper mad dash\nA friend request, follow, and a hashtag\nNow everybody want it like the last laugh\nA Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask\nPurple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class\nStable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad\nBut corporate jets really had to have that gas bad\nWar and they hope they all fall from the ratatat\n'Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillac\nYou might also like\nLive from the other side, what you see?\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\n'Porting live from the other side, what you hear?\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\n'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way\n\nAnd we marvel at the state of Ottoman\nThen turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can\nAmerica's a big motherfuckin' garbageman\nIf you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem\nYou say no you ain't, and I say yes you is\nSoon as you find out what planned obsolescence is\nYou say no they didn't, and I say yes they did\nThe definition of unnecessary-ness\nManifested\nSay that we should protest just to get arrested\nThat goes against all my hustling ethics\nA bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective\nDepart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip\nInsert Baldwin to similar the separate\nTo me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit\nOr finding really fast internet to have some sex with\nIt's all one song short of a set list\nCouple croissants shy of a continental breakfast\nOr blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish\nSo absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace\nDown at the Lakota Sioux Casino\nA whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno\nI go as left as a heart in the chest\n'Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death\nLive from the other side, what you see?\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\n'Porting live from the other side, what you hear?\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\n'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way\n\nAn all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler\nHope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar\nSouth Central, an example of God's gifts\nSo shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6\nThe projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns\nMonopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound\nIt\u2019s parts of Manila like the video for \"Thriller\"\nBut the U.S. Embassy is reminiscent of a villa\nIf poverty is chocolate and privilege, vanilla\nThen what\u2019s the flavor of the Sunday preacher\u2019s pedophilia?\nCash rules everything around these niggas\nAs classrooms everywhere around me wither\nHither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers\nThe tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the mid-ler\nOf the extremes of

from the set, yeah!\n\nFirst off, say \"Peace\" to Pine Ridge\nShame at all the damage that the white man wine did\nGhost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year\nAnd all that other crime did\nMore peace to the teachers of blind kids\nTo rebels in small cells keeping their mind big\nSay everything's hostile, suicide bombers\nAnd prosperity gospels, emaciated models\nWith cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils\nThey got to, just to stay awake\nOn the catwalk of life where everybody watch you\nStraight hair, high heels, and a handbag\nCrucifixes, racism, and a land grab\nKatrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags\nA peace sign and a pants sag\nA money toss cause a nine-stripper mad dash\nA friend request, follow, and a hashtag\nNow everybody want it like the last laugh\nA Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask\nPurple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class\nStable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad\nBut corporate jets really had to have that gas bad\nWar and they hope they all fall from the ratatat\n'Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillac\n\nLive from the other side, what you see?\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\n'Porting live from the other side, what you hear?\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\n'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way\n\nAnd we marvel at the state of Ottoman\nThen turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can\nAmerica's a big motherfuckin' garbageman\nIf you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem\nYou say no you ain't, and I say yes you is\nSoon as you find out what planned obsolescence is\nYou say no they didn't, and I say yes they did\nThe definition of unnecessary-ness\nManifested\nSay that we should protest just to get arrested\nThat goes against all my hustling ethics\nA bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective\nDepart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip\nInsert Baldwin to similar the separate\nTo me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit\nOr finding really fast internet to have some sex with\nIt's all one song short of a set list\nCouple croissants shy of a continental breakfast\nOr blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish\nSo absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace\nDown at the Lakota Sioux Casino\nA whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno\nI go as left as a heart in the chest\n'Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death\n\nLive from the other side, what you see?\nA bunch of nonsense on my TV\nHeaven on Earth is what I need\nBut I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe\n'Porting live from the other side, what you hear?\nA bunch of nonsense all in my ear\nRich man, poor man, we all gotta pay\n'Cause freedom ain't free, 'specially round my way\n\nAn all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler\nHope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar\nSouth Central, an example of

take back the words I never said\n\nI really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit\nJust a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets\nHow much money does it take to really make a full clip?\n9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?\nUh, and a bunch of other coverups\nYour child's future was the first to go with budget cuts\nIf you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut\nThe school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up\nKeep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust\nYou get it, then they move it, so you never keeping up enough\nIf you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks\nDude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such\nAnd that ain't Jersey Shore, homie, that's the news\nAnd these the same people supposedly telling us the truth\nLimbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist\nGaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit\nThat's why I ain't vote for him, next one either\nI'm a part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful\nAnd I believe in the people, yeah\nYou might also like\nIt's so loud inside my head\nWith words that I should have said\nAs I drown in my regrets\nI can't take back the words I never said\n\nNow we can say it ain't our fault if we never heard it\nBut if we know better, then we probably deserve it\nJihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?\nMurdering is not Islam, and you are not observant\nAnd you are not a Muslim\nIsrael don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them\nWalk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went\nComplain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?\nComplain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?\nJust listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop\nA rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt\nIf you don't become a actor, you'll never be a factor\nPills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt\nWash 'em down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells\nCrooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today\nSo if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away\nIt's so loud inside my head\nWith words that I should have said\nAs I drown in my regrets\nI can't take back the words I never said, never said\nI can't take back the words I never said\nI think that all the silence is worse than all the violence\nFear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it\nWe scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth\nSo scared of what you think of me, I'm scared of even telling you\nSometimes I'm like the only person I feel safe to tell it to\nI'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you\nConsider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few\nMy screams is finally getting free, my thoughts is finally yelling through\n\nIt's so loud inside my head\nWith words that I should have said\nAs I drown in my regrets\nI can't take back the words I never said51Embed\nIt's so loud

as evil as Lu get?\nWell that's cause you ain't Lu, bitch\nTook two sips of the holy grail\nThen I backed up and I turned around\nAnd I bent over and pittoo'd shit\nI love Jay, that's my nigga\nI feel sicker than a cruise ship\nI ain't competition, I don't move shit\nThe only opposition is this new shit\nThese new niggas rappin' like they 2\nThey be actin' like they you, man that's-- wheeeeeew

said, but what he said means we dead\nAnd that shit is insane\nHe's so crazy, look at the little baby\nNigga you ain't Nas, nigga you ain't Jay-Z\nYou will respect me, you will reject me\nBut I've done so much, no matter how far you go, you will reflect me\nSLR, nigga please\nThese niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave\nAnd when the bitch gone, knee shots disabled\nDVD of Dick Jones in your TV and a grenade all on your table.\nAnd my punch bowl's like an ocean\nAnd I lay it on by the ladle\nBut it's so strong, when I pull it out, I'm only hangin' on to a handle\nSatan on my ankles while I'm hangin' on to an angel\nAin't hatin' on that you hatin' wrong, cause you can't hang on to my angles\nIt's hard being a Lupe fan, go to Harvard to be a Lupe stan\nI ain't sayin' that I'm harder, it's just harder when it's in Lupe's hands\nWelcome nigga, Lupe Land, SLR\nHere we go, FL bars\nHold up, go back to the hard part\nWould say pause, but I was talkin'

feel sicker than a cruise ship\nI ain't competition, I don't move shit\nThe only opposition is this new shit\nThese new niggas rappin' like they 2\nThey be actin' like they you, man that's-- wheeeeeew shit\nWhat happened to the game?\nNiggas think they Jappin' cause they rappin' like they Wayne\nRappin' like they Chainz\nI ain't matchin' them in platinum\nBut I'm rappin' like I'm flames\nLike smackin' them in the back of him and my antonyms is on 'cain\nAnd my heroin is on metaphors and my metaphors is on brains\nMy left foot is in LA but my right foot is in Spain\nNow we all heard what he said, but what he said means we dead\nAnd that shit is insane\nHe's so crazy, look at the little baby\nNigga you ain't Nas, nigga you ain't Jay-Z\nYou will respect me, you will reject me\nBut I've done so much, no matter how far you go, you will reflect me\nSLR, nigga please\nThese niggas 'bout to go to work so these bitches gon' have to leave\nAnd when the bitch gone, knee shots disabled\nDVD of Dick Jones in your TV and a grenade all on your table.\nAnd my punch bowl's like an ocean\nAnd I lay it on by the ladle\nBut it's so strong, when I pull it out, I'm only hangin' on to a handle\nSatan on my ankles while I'm hangin' on to an angel\nAin't hatin' on that you hatin' wrong, cause you can't hang on to my angles\nIt's hard being a Lupe fan, go to Harvard to be a Lupe stan\nI ain't sayin' that I'm harder, it's just harder when it's in Lupe's hands\nWelcome nigga, Lupe Land, SLR\nHere we go, FL bars\nHold up, go back to the hard part\nWould say pause, but I was talkin' 'bout my own balls\nNigga"

diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nWith a circle on the floor he compels them to be pure\nPulls the beast out of his heart then impales it on a sword\nWrites a prayer on some paper and then he nails it to the door\nJust the good of you may enter by the mercy of the lord\nListen not to what he speaks, that's been the cursing of his cause\nA seduction of his senses by the devils he adores\nThe unholy has him hostage and his soul is now at war\nFollow not his secret knowledge it will bring you no reward\nShun him while in public disallow him from your stores\nHave no part in his affairs 'less his pestilence be yours\nMake scoundrels of the righteous and virgins into whores\nBut we must still pray that his color will be cured\nYou might also like\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nWith her eyes to the ceiling and a needle in her brain\nHe looks back into the crowd, wipes the blood and then explains\nHow she slipped from this existence to the realm of the deranged\nHer becoming must be halted to reverse what she became\nFrom the looseness of her tongue, to the pollution of her aims\nTo do nothing is barbaric, the solution is humane\nYou must destroy the mind and hopefully retrain\nYou torture out the wildness, then replace it with the tame\nBlank slate when she recovers, she won't even know her name\nPerfect wife and perfect lover, no resistance, no complaints\nMay God bless the scientific cure for the insane\nKnew she couldn't go to school, but she thought that that should change\n\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nWith his crucifix inside his pocket said his mission is divine\nPut his Bible on the bed and then he touched on his behind\nTold him take off all his clothes and put your penis next to mine\nNow the little boy think it's normal because they do this all the time\nWith no life inside his body now he finally think he\u2019s safe\nBut they cut off all his fingers while they piss all in his face\nHe take pictures with his killers then they sneak back to the states\nNow he sit next to the picture of his wife when she was raped\nWith the teleprompter rolling he looks right into the lens\nDoesn\u2019t mention his redemption but absolves him of his sins\nHe forgives them in advance says that he will do again\nMy fellow Americans...\n\nI see diamond-flooded demons\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nLamborghini angels\nHalos down with the doors flapping when they came through\nHalos down with

(Ugh)\nIf y'all ain't know\nI go by the name of Lupe Fiasco\n(Kick, push, coast)\nRepresenting that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh\nAnd this one right here (Woo!)\nI dedicate this one right here (Uproxx...)\nTo all my homies out there grinding\nYou know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha\nYou know what I'm talking about? (Woo!)\nSo, check it out, uh\n\nFirst got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks\nMatter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped\nLanded on his hip and busted his lip\nFor a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)\nNow we can end the story right here\nBut shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)\nYeah, he said it was something so appealing\nHe couldn't fight the feeling, something about it\nHe knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it\nBranded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)\nLabeled a misfit, a bandit\nKa-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it\nSo, he was banished to the park\nStarted in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah\nWhen they said \"It's getting late in here\nSo I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here\"\nYou might also like\nAnd so he kick, push, kick, push\nKick, push, kick, push; coast...\nAnd away he rolled\nJust a rebel to the world with no place to go\nAnd so he kick, push, kick, push\nKick, push, kick, push; coast...\nSo come and skate with me\nJust a rebel looking for a place to be\n\nSo let's kick...

I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds\" (Woo!)\n\"Now, let me make one thing clear\nI don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here\"\nSo she took him to a spot he didn't know about\nSome odd-end apartment parking lot\nShe said \"I don't normally take dates in here\"\nSecurity came and said \"I'm sorry, there's no skating here\"\nAnd so they kick, push, kick, push\nKick, push, kick, push; coast...\nAnd away they roll\nJust lovers intertwined with no place to go\nAnd so they kick, push, kick, push\nKick, push, kick, push; coast...\nSo come and skate with me\nJust a rebel looking for a place to be\n\nSo let's kick (Ugh, ugh)\nAnd push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)\nAnd coast...

(Dumb it down!)\n(Dumb it down!)\n\nI'm fearless, now hear this, I'm earless\nAnd I'm peerless, that means I'm eyeless\nWhich means I'm tearless, which means my iris\nResides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded\nBut I'ma find it, I can feel its nearness\nBut I'ma veer, so I don't come near\nLike a chicken or a deer, but I remember\nI'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear\nHere you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this\nClearly cause my blindness\nThe windshield is menstrual, the whole grill is roadkill\nSo trill and so sincere, yeah, I'm both them there\nTook both pills when the bloke in the trench coat\nAnd the locs in the chair had approached him here\nMade it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror\nThe writer of the quotes for the ghosts\nWho supplier of the notes to the living\nRiveting as Rosie, pockets full of posies\nGiven to the mother of the deceased\nAwake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace\nYou might also like\nYou going over niggas heads, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey telling me that they don't feel you (Dumb it down!)\nWe ain't graduate from school, nigga (Dumb it down!)\nThem big words ain't cool, nigga (Dumb it down!)\nYeah I heard \"Mean and Vicious,\" nigga (Dumb it down!)\nMake a song for the bitches, nigga! (Dumb it down!)\nWe don't care about the weather nigga (Dumb it down!)\nYou'll sell more records if you (Dumb it down!)\n\nAnd I'm mouthless, which means I'm soundless\nNow as far as the hearing, I've found it\nIt was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is\nBut the doorknockers on the ear\nOf a stewardess in a Lear, she's fine and she's flying\nI feel I'm flying by 'em, cause my mind's on cloud nine\nAnd in a mine at the same time\nPimps see the wings on the Underground King\nWho's also Klingon, to infinity and beyond\nSomething really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon\nOr lion in the desert\nI'm flying on Pegasus, you're flying on a pheasant\nWriter of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers\nSpit, \"hot fiya\" like Dylan on Chappelle's skit\nYeah, smell it on my unicorn\nDon't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn\nSleep?\nYou've been shedding too much light, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nYou're makin 'em wanna do right, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey're gettin' self-esteem, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThese girls are trying to be queens, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey're trying to graduate from school, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey're startin' to think that smart is cool, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey're trying to get up out the hood, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nI'll tell you what you should do (Dumb it down!)\n\nAnd I'm brainless, which means I'm headless\nLike Ichabod Crane is\nOr foreplay-less sex is, which makes me saneless\nWith no neck left to hang the chain with\nWhich makes me necklace-less, like a necklace theft\nAnd I ain't used my headrest yet\nThey said they need proof like a vestless chest\nAbout the best-fed F-F jet in the nest\nWho exudes confidence and excess depth\nEven Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe\nAround these leagues; my snorkel is a tuba\nLu the ruler around these seas\nWestside Poseidon, Westside beside 'em\nChest-high and rising, almost touching the knees\nOf stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make ya fly with\nPersonal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves\nDavid Blaine, make it rain\nYou make a boat, I make a plane\nThen, I pull the plug and I make it drain\nUntil I feel like flowing and filling it up again\nWestside!\nYou putting me to sleep, nigga (Dumb it down!)\n'S'why you ain't popping in the streets, nigga!

don't sine\nYou look just like how I'ma be\nSacred geometry\nIn a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line\nThree angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine\n\nWith a platinum plaque, it's like Robbin, George, and Jack\nThe mind fears what the blinds hide but I'm here on the blind side\nHanging up 'til the line dies then off the hook for the crimes tried\nGet awful looks from tribe tribe, unlawful jux when you climb skies\nThat's Robin Hood, arrows of the rich'll steal\nIn Hollywood and featherweight, I step by step, let it escalate\n'Til you get it, will tell you if I hit it\nWe can make pie if we don't fidget\nXzibit, Pimp My Ride exquisite\nWe G's coach us back if we die in business, my Lord is my chemist\nMy sword is from Khemet, Egyptian fonts and ankhs\nScottish writes with Montblancs let us stomp\nI walk as my father walk, master builder is what I thought\n\nYou look just like how I'ma be\nSacred geometry\nIn a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a

straight, don't sine\nYou might also like\nWhere the golden means, so the overseer gets overseen\nAnd the over here's are the older things\nCan see the bell but don't know the rings\nThe rings are not sounds, but circles, wear these on your virtues\nSee through these circles just like Steve Urkel, 'til it's all universal\nAnd it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size\nAnd it's dynamic in the high standard\nSo each degree has a part to price\nSee big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity\nAnd little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity\n\nYou look just like

in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line\nThree angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine\nThe applause of patrons at the laws in nature\nOverride lies and the laws of nations\nPilgrims bear witness at all the stations\nSun positions overcome traditions\nNumbers govern our young religions\nDead levels making plumb decisions\nPerpendicular to the undivision\nThat's bad curricular to the unconditioned\nAny love less than unconditional is so\nUnder-Christian, it's unrepentant\nThe physical part of my church\nEmits the invisible arts of my work\nTo make gold from garbage\nIs not the alchemical point of this math\nBut truth be told it's the pursuit of gold\nThat turns the goal of men into trash\nThe soul's gold and they turning gold into cash\nAnd your reflection is your connection\nTo more collections of more directions and paths\nIf your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass\nTo see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half\nYou look just like how I'ma be\nSacred geometry\nIn a line, in a line, in a line, in a line, in a line\nThree angels in kind, on time, go straight, don't sine\nYou look just like how I'ma be\nSacred

black tee, slide\nMy baby momma done fucked up on her food stamps\nThat\u2019s three months to re-certify\nI\u2019m ridin', niggas be watching, they don\u2019t want these problems\nWhen them bills due, niggas get ready 'cause no bullshit, I'm plottin'\nI\u2019m a government baby, let me get my cheese, let me get my cheese\nGot a seven-trey in my momma yard, sittin' on D's\nI\u2019m 'bout this fee, I\u2019m 'bout this fee, just know what\u2019s free\nYou were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, so don\u2019t critique\nLook at me nigga, just a young hood nigga, tryna get this cake\nI

hood\nNigga you see it, better believe it, this what I\u2019m 'bout\nGot a trap house that be boomin', nigga, fiends in and out\nCut the check, anyway it come, nigga, Section 8\nSee we straight, see this money I make, this block can stay, ha\n\nYeah bitch, filet mignon with my food stamps\nWould tell you I don\u2019t but it won't be the truth\nLet me hit you back on my government phone\nStill a hood nigga, whatcha want me to do?\nWe get a blunt and a joint out a sawbuck of loud\nWhere I\u2019m from we be actually hoopin\u2019 in Jordans\nFive dollar white t-shirts and them loose cigarettes\nAin\u2019t nobody finna do shit important\nPeople really don\u2019t give no fuck about nothing\nAlthough they may smile and be cordial\nDealin\u2019 around with the wrong damn crowd\nThen bring a frown to my friend, I'm in an alley, we warned you\nBackground check for the chopper\nThe barrel breathin' back down the neck of imposters\nThe murder rate ain\u2019t back down yet\nCause they ain't wrote that down yet to the nigga that was tryna say he saw somethin\u2019\nSome people, listen\nYou could be predisposed or be preconditioned\nOr speak with the preacher, been preaching, be the person\nTo put some process in your progress or be the prevention\nI just live my life and I don\u2019t stop grindin' until God tell me to\nI get money, I ain\u2019t gotta sell my soul, ho, who the hell is you?\nThey say my kind ain\u2019t welcome everywhere, well I can deal with that\nBut those who pop they shit get the shit popped outta them\nIt's still a fact\nSo mind your business and stay the fuck outta mine\nYou\u2019ll solve you'll find that this is\nBest for everyone involved, all in all, the Lord my witness\nYeah, uhh, f-f-filet mignon with my food stamps (mm)\nCar cosigned by my

obstacles\nMy teachers all told me that were probable\nProbable cause, no cracker never really had it\nI was just a nigga in a high price whip\nYeah, I\u2019m just a nigga with an education brought up in the ghetto\nWhere you better have extension on the clip\nWell beef comes around in the town\nMore often than these bitches' emotions\nI got a yopper, five dollars, off the streets (yeah I'm totin')\nFor protection more than anything though (you gon' test my devotion)\nMy first amendment right, they violate it anytime we outspoken\nChicago violence boostin\u2019 up but we just focusin\u2019\nOn other environments cause the country taking notice\nMore fiends are risin', molly the new dope\nAnd I apologize cause it was something I was promotin\u2019\nChopper in my bitch name in case I light somebody up\nYou just tell them it was stolen\nRich gunplay, shit that\u2019s all they see, that\u2019s all they know\nWithout it kinda hopeless\nSaid this in \u201909 and still no medicare for grandma\nI done said all their names and niggas still ain't want no anna\nLu probably tell me, \"Trouble, you gotta put the mac down\nFelonies all in your background\"\nSaid this in

lungs of your sons\nTell your daughters the water's a treasure\nSummon the forest\nTalkin' to trees, now how could you be in the chorus\nWith something so horrid?\nYou became boards for the floors and the doors of the warships\nAnthropomorphic, the forest returned with a match\nMade from itself and said, \"Burn us with that\"\nThen left again and came back with a axe\nWe can serve you as furniture or furnace us black, ayy\n\nMy bones is why the beach is white\nWhy the beach is white 'cause they bleached us light\nSo I'm goin' back home, I took a leap last night\nSo I'm walkin' on water 'til my

Well I'm like ten, eleven\nBeen fighting since I was like six or seven\nNow I don't know much about where I'm from\nBut I know I strike fear everywhere I come\nGovernment want me dead so I wear my gun\nI really want the rocket launcher but I'm still too young\nThis candy give me courage not to fear no one\nTo feel no pain and hear no tongue\nSo I hear no screams and I shed no tear\nIf I'm in your dreams then your end is near, yeah\nYou might also like\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe're calling you\nThere's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you\nWe'll find you something small to use\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe need you now, blaow!\n\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\n\nNow here comes the march of the boy brigade\nA macabre parade of the toys he made\nIn shemaghs and shades, who look half his age\nAbout half the size of the flags they wave\nAnd camouflage suits made to fit youths\n'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a lil' loose\nWhere AK47s that they shooting into heaven\nLike they tryna kill a Jetson, the struggles, little recruits\nCute, smileless, heartless, violent\nChildhood destroyed, devoid of all childish ways\nCan't write their own names\nOr read the words that's on they own graves\nThink you gangsta?

I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk\nGot ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks\nThat's when I heard murder\n\"You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow\nSunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows\"\nI turn to see my dream, love supreme queen\nMeanest thing on the scene cry\nI drop my bags in a flash, that's faster\nThan 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears\nAnd wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher\nYou's the dame who's the username to all my passwords\nThe reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper\nI even keep your picture in my passport\nLove, love\nYou might also like\nLet's go to sleep in Paris\nWake up in Tokyo\nHave a dream in New Orleans\nFall in love in Chicago, man\nThen we can land in the motherland\nCamel-back across the desert sand\nAnd take a train, to Rome, or home\nBrazil, for real\nWherever I go she goes\nWherever I go she goes\n\nSo let's keep it real, all in together, \"Free Chill\"\nTell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel\nHeat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills\nLean back in my first class seat and sleep\nDon't wake me 'til I land\nWhere they barely understand what I speak\nBut they nod to my beats\nI tell my fans who I am and they stand\nAnd they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God\nOtsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir\nA spree on Saint-Honor\u00e9, then back to Charles de Gaulle\nSo I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and\nEverything that I done, and\nTell her that she's the one, and, umm\nLet's go to sleep in Paris\nWake up in Tokyo\nHave a dream in New Orleans\nFall in love in Chicago, man\nThen we can land in the motherland\nCamel-back across the desert sand\nAnd take a train, to Rome, or home\nBrazil, for real\nWherever I go she goes\nWherever I go she goes\n\nGuess who's back in the house\nWith a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth\nI really missed you, each and every night I kissed you\nIn my dreams 'fore I went to sleep\nTo la-la land to count them sheep\nI swear you're looking prettier than ever\nIt's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore\nFor better or, less or poor\nOr worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore\nI know my world tour's like war to you\nBut Ian said, \"Aloha\", and Harley said, \"Cheers\"\nJulian said, \"Bonjour\", Big O was like, \"Yeah!\"\nAmanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there\nEdison sends his love, so does the rest of the club\nOf the international playboys and playgirls\nBut I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness\nShe said, \"Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless\nI'll be there, by your side\nIn your heart, and on your mind\"\nSo, as I taxi down another runway\nI gotcha, who loves you bae\nNow bring it back now\nLet's go to sleep in Paris\nWake up in Tokyo\nHave a dream in New Orleans\nFall in love in Chicago, man\nThen we can land in the motherland\nCamel-back across the desert sand\nAnd take a train, to Rome, or home\nBrazil, for real\nWherever I go she goes\nWherever I go she goes\nWherever I go she goes\nWherever I go she goes24Embed\nI know, I know but I gotta get up outta here, you know?\nI gotta go pay these bills, I got a show to do, you know?\nOne time, for your mind\nLet's go to sleep in Paris\nWake up in Tokyo\nHave a dream in New Orleans\nFall in love in Chicago, man\nWherever I go she go\n\nI love her, and I hate to leave her lonely\nRing-ring went the iPhone, it was my homie\nHe said, \"Let's hit Japan, if we can make 'em jam\nWe can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France\"\nNothing further;

guts of the mother\nCampbell should move her undercover\nWith a $3,000 son she just want a lover\nAnd somebody else to come and try and drug her\nTake her off the grill, she done\n(they will never love you)\nPills celebrating, \"We won\"\nIn the system of the women, never knew he had it in him\nThis condition when the world that they make him become\n(None of you)\nCocaine and new high tech ways, smuggle whole things\n(I've always loved you)\nFrom the control range that make radio heads with gold brains\n(All of you)\nTo park 84' Jags on gold chains\nDeveloping nicks from a whole name\nGod is great, but it's snakes on my soul plane\nYou might also like\nCloset full of bones, just don't try to put 'em back together\n(Try to put 'em back together)\nThey know just by my tone so

poppin' tags, droppin' trash\nIn shopping bags 'til Akeem take our pocket cash\n(Am I beautiful?)\nWrite it in lights, molly in the body of Christ\nDrop me to the lobby from heights (trust me)\nThen over the threshold to redeem the doorway\nFourteen broads like the king of Norway\nFourteen broads having dreams of foreplay\nFourteen arm Shiva, viva la coup!\n(Love you) If the government get it,

he didn't mind it, but\u2014\nHe couldn't sip it fast enough\nSo, the liquor was just fillin' the casket up\nFloatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister\nSecond-grade handwriting simply read, \"I miss ya\"\nSuit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture\nRight next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher\nHe had a notion as he laid there soakin'\nHe saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open\nAnd he...\nYou might also like\nThis life goes passing you by\nIt might go fast if you lie\nYou born, you live, then you die\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nIf life goes passing you by\nDon't cry\nIf you're breaking the rules, making your moves (Yeah)\nPaying your dues (Uh-huh), chasing the cool\n\nNot at all nervous as he dug to the surface\nTarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with\nHe used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it\nAnd when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it\nWorking like a... hmm... reverse archaeologist\nExcept his buried treasure was sunshine\nSo when some shined through a hole that he had drove\nIt reflected off the gold and almost made son blind\nHe grabbed onto some grass and climbed\nPulled hisself up out of his own grave and looked at the time\nOn the watch that had stopped six months after the shots\nThat'd got him in the box;

he didn't mind it, but\u2014\nHe couldn't sip it fast enough\nSo, the liquor was just fillin' the casket up\nFloatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister\nSecond-grade handwriting simply read, \"I miss ya\"\nSuit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture\nRight next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher\nHe had a notion as he laid there soakin'\nHe saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open\nAnd he...\n\nThis life goes passing you by\nIt might go fast if you lie\nYou born, you live, then you die\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nIf life goes passing you by\nDon't cry\nIf you're breaking the rules, making your moves (Yeah)\nPaying your dues (Uh-huh), chasing the cool\n\nNot at all nervous as he dug to the surface\nTarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with\nHe used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it\nAnd when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it\nWorking like a... hmm... reverse archaeologist\nExcept his buried treasure was sunshine\nSo when some shined through a hole that he had drove\nIt reflected off the gold and almost made son blind\nHe grabbed onto some grass and climbed\nPulled hisself up out of his own grave and looked at the time\nOn the watch that had stopped six months after the shots\nThat'd got him in the box; wringing Henny out his socks\nFigured it was hours because he wasn't older\nUsed some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder\nSo, with a right hand that was all bones\nAnd no reason to stay, he decided to walk home\nSo he...\n\nThis life goes passing you by\nIt might go fast if you lie (Yeah)\nYou born, you live, then you die\nOh-oh-oh-oh\nIf life goes passing you by\nDon't cry (Ugh)\nIf you're breaking the rules (Yeah), making your moves (Ugh)\nPaying your dues (Ugh), chasing the cool\n\nHe begged for some change to get him on the train\n\"Damn, that nigga stank\" is what they complained\nTried to light the blunt, but it burst into flames\nCaught the reflection in the window of what he became\nA long look;

got it and want you to have it next and\nDon't accept them if you want to stay as an exception\nNo pill can heal the ill of this\nSickness, some are still in doubt of its existence\nSome call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance\nSome say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance\nThe poor say the rich have the cure\nThe rich say the poor are the source\nRevolutionaries say it's

What is it missin'? Is it dry?\nDid it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed\nAnd the tension from its demise\nPulled all of the flavor from the fat and made it flat\nAnd rather lifeless, well there's a place\nThat has a stunning turbot and more mercifully murdered Pisces\nBut barbaric are still the prices\nIt's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices\nMy son will call risotto rices\nIf and when he's left to his own devices, well\nHow is your memory? Is it returning like a lemon tree\nTo bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me?\nOr was it slippin' like permission? Am I trippin' like field\nI feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission\nStill left out the life, also left out the will, grief\nWill cheese never touch your teeth\nMaybe like kosher beef\nIs it real? Is it real? Is it real? Ha, hah!\nHowl at the day\nCan I make you my prey?\nCause I want you dear, ooh, I want you dear\nThe hell that we raised\nTo the heavens make symmetries for\nOur petite mort, our petite mort\nSo glad you're back\nBut not glad at that you're glatt\nWhere is the glamour in collapse?\nWhere in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds?\nSwoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon\nThe atelier slowly fills with baboons\nAnd other monkey business\nWhere killers go free cause the junkie's a funky witness\nRunny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death\nBygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks\nSeparated by a sea of cooling num nums\nReminiscing of an every day playing hum drum\nWhere recognition went unnoticed\nAnd then solidified till it was stoic\nWe should've been poets\nSomewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter\nHow are your chains?\nDo they make you behave?\nKeep you over here, by your overseer\nFallen from grace\nDown from Heaven to memories' floor\nLa petite mort, la petite mort16Embed\nNow bring it out like a finger in the back of your mouth\nCherubs and cerebellum\nTerror at Sarah's wedding, Sam marrying Sam\nBand pushed upon the finger of Sam's hairiest hand (OOOH!)\nIf that sickens you, you a bigot\nIf it doesn't, well then you're wicked\nSuch is life, odd as Egg McMuffins at night\nNo answers, so let us watch these dancers\nStructure reformed gracefully being born\nOn the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals\nKaleidoscope into a Eiffel\nIt ripples then it tidals, vacillates then it virals\nBabylons then it Bibles and others\nAnd tell me of the spinning mothers\nAnd today's mathematics for beloved\nAnd beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers\nHow was your day?\nCan I make what you say what I wanna hear?\nCause I want you here\nThe hell that we raised\nTo the heavens do anything for\nLa petite mort, la petite mort\n\nThey keep the bottles just to make glass houses\nThen climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it\nThen expect not a volley in reply\nSome place vulnerable like probably in the eye\nWhat of the chicken?

With liberty and justice for all\nNeatly carved in what seems to be a wall\nThey would doubt that there was any starvation at all\nThat they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved\nFrom the sheer amount of paper, most likely used for trade\nEverything's so organized. They had to be well behaved\nAssumed they had clean energy, little to no enemies\nVery honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies\nReligions kinda complex.

rule\nThese fools are my fuel, so I make them cool\n(Let me put you on game)\nBaptize them in the water out of Scarface pool\nAnd feed them from the table that held Corleone's food\nIf you die, tell

and Poohs, niggas and jews\nMr. Opulent Christopher Robinson too\nReversal like\nWhen that predetermined term expires on a turtle's knife\nWhat of Korea, are you scared?\nOr is something not there, like a Welsh rabbit full of hares\nAnimal farms and imaginary bears\nThe body is a house like a kangaroo pouch\nOr an oyster-hoisted cow over crescent moons as it looms low in the night sky\nPlatoons of coons stand ready for the drive-by\nSteady as the medley booms from the Akai\nAffirm as in \"Aye aye\"\nLike it the second\nLike a junior, like a third, like a eye\nLike a observe from the view of a bird as it fly high\nSitting heavy like spaghetti in the belly of a wise guy\nWho let these G's out the PI_STY?\nSeems they taking cues from The Wire\nOkay decorum, and keeping you from wanting to buy it\nBut you still buy it like you never left its sight\nAnd like a slow gunfighter gun: unfired\nCow dung walls, hermit crabs in the mall, sting ray from the stars and barnyard laws\nThese are\nYou might also like\nHey hey, just cause I got thumbs, that don't mean everybody is dumb, huh huh?\nJust cause I got one, that don't mean that they not dumb, what what?\n\nQuiet as a mouse in the House of God\nIn the jaws, like tyrants in the mouths of mobs\nRipping it to pieces like a picture and a preacher\nIf a cricket was a speaker, it's its own chicken bones on the garbage can top\nUgly mother freakers is predator, opposite, on top of it, to make it fox\nSo if similar appeal, administer the seal to make it real\nElephantine but never mind\nHalf-ton gorillas in a midst, they'll never find\nHungry as a hippopotamus, gobble it 'til your bottom and your body is as wobbly as Skrillex\nEeyores and Piglets, blind bats nailing tails to a riblet\nTime only limited(ed) if you make it\nBlind rat's nails hold tales of Unseeing Eye selves\nOut is out, so they only seeing thy shells\nGhost Dog\nOh lawd\nThese are\n\nHey they not dumb\nI ain't smart just cause I got thumbs, what, say what?\nHey hey, just cause I got one\nThat don't mean I'm better cause they got none, say what, say what say what?\nThe butcher says to the bovines\nYou're all just pastrami when it's showtime\nCowboy co-signs, attack the cat samples\nOwn worst enemies\nChop down the trees, we need the axe handles\nLike a heel in a sandal saying \"hell no\"\nOr you trapped like the yells of a nail in the shell-toe\nClever as a fishbowl on a sailboat\nLandlocked as a ham hock on a railroad\nSandbox by the swimming pool\nTwo times as clever as a fishing school\nPills for the pressure\nBroken seals on the pills for the pleasure\nIf you feeling ill, whatever\nAnimal farm, you're all dumb\nTickle 'em with your articulated thumb\nA tapeworm will never play the drums, but um\nThese are\nThese are\n\nHey hey, just cause I got one\nThat don't mean I'm smart cause they got none\nW-what, w-what\nAm I not an animal cause I got thumbs?\nThat don't make me smart cause they got none, say what?\nW-what, w-what\nHere we come\nAm I not an animal cause I got thumbs, say what?\nSay what, say what?16Embed\nQuiet as a kitten\nReply as silent as a Raphael-given instrument for stickin'\nOr maybe riot as a lion\nWould he tie in tiger for attention?\nTiggers and Poohs, niggas and jews\nMr. Opulent Christopher Robinson too\nReversal like\nWhen that predetermined term expires on a turtle's knife\nWhat of Korea, are you scared?\nOr is something not there, like a Welsh rabbit full of hares\nAnimal farms and imaginary bears\nThe body is a house like a kangaroo pouch\nOr an oyster-hoisted cow over crescent moons as it looms low in the night sky\nPlatoons of coons stand ready for the drive-by\nSteady as the medley booms from the Akai\nAffirm as in \"Aye aye\"\nLike it the second\nLike a junior, like a third, like a eye\nLike a observe from the view of a bird as it fly high\nSitting heavy like spaghetti in the belly of a wise guy\nWho let these G's out the PI_STY?\nSeems they taking cues from The Wire\nOkay decorum, and keeping you from wanting to buy it\nBut you still buy it like you never left its sight\nAnd like a slow gunfighter gun: unfired\nCow dung walls, hermit crabs in

time to learn me like court-appointed attorneys\nRestore the order, we either join or adjourning\nLess you join, I'm up performing the journey\nIn all earnest, I go so Bernie\nTakes another nigga to turn me\nGet it straight, I ain't late on states\nI'm just sternly stating\nHow what I do, with grace takes another nigga to turn mean\nMy returning's like Blockbuster with a tape\nAnd I ain't kind but I don't hit\nSo you starting at the end, that's the part where you begin\nI skip the bullshit so we can start it where we win\nYeah, spoiler alert\nI can hear you all saying, \"Boy, you're a jerk\"\nBut it's cool though, know we gotta rule yo\nGet it in, then we win and do it all again, ho\nYou might also like\nFrom the floating death, to the fire of death\nTo a flower outside of my grave\nAn old man\nOr were you just being polite with your hands?\nAnd it really means I'm number one, and you're a fan\nWell that's cool, cause I think you're number one too\nYeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one too\nYeah that's cool, cause I think you're number one\n\nNow me and words, we made a deal, that I'm gon' keep 'em real\nAnd they show me their secrets, I can even cop a feel\nVictorious\nCan't match wit, with warriors\nI match wig with wits\nSimilarly can't mix matchsticks with forests\nOnly you can prevent what I do\nOnly dew can prevent what's my view\nI match matchsticks with wicks\nWicker man, take a sip of liquor and\nSpit the lip off warriors\nAnd spit flames, nigga, get in the gang, ahh\n\nFrom the floating death, to the fire of death\nTo a flower

that's cool, cause I think you're number one too, yeah\nWell that's for me, heh, yeah I think you're number one too\nIt's road rage, without a roll cage\nTakes courage to run on these roadways\nI know you like \"No way\" but I'm a full race\nAll so every soccer Terry Fox molding\nGo ahead\nDon't stop, go ahead\nSitting in your car, just listening to the bars\nAnd there's traffic all around and you feel like falling down\nAnd the music that I'm spewing out, enough to calm it down\n'Fore you know you're out your car with your briefcase walkin' round\nAnd them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production\nAnd Sebastian on the hook like being dug by Michael Douglas (yeah!)\nSo don't start that walk through Echo Park\nWhen life's a one-on-one and you caught up in the jam\nJust show some love back to your number one fan\n\nFrom the floating death, to the fire of death\nTo a flower outside of my grave\nAn old man\nOr were you just being polite with your hands?\nAnd it really means I'm

how to locksmith, see, the box is locked in a box\nAin't got the combination to unlock it\nThat's why he watches, scared to look away\n'Cause at that moment, it might show him\nWhat to take off the locks with\n\nSo he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it\nSwallowed the combination and then forgot it\nAs the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils\nThe same

coming out the box, he blocks it\nSee, he loves the box and hope they never stop it\nAnything the box tell him to do, he does it\nAnything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it\nHe protects the box, locks it in a box\nWhen he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps\n'Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away\n'Cause at that moment, it might get stolen\nAnd that's the last of the boxes\n\nSo he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it\nSwallowed the combination and then forgot it\nAs the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils\nThe same ones

might have to guillotine him\nI sing some but I rap a lot like the king's son\nMicrophone checker all across the board you should king him\nDiamond mine my mind make princesses like king cum\nEvery second worth of thinking\nIs enough to fill three rings like Ringlings\nThat's how I kept it on the air is like a re-run\nAnd kept the kings comin' in obscene sums\nYou see for me it's life or death like a king thumb\nMean something\nThat's why I don't play when I relay like a team run\nAnd treat every single day like a scene one\nOutlook on life like I ain't never seen none\n\nI keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)\nFace to the future tell it hi (hi)\nEverything is super so is fly (fly)\nCome and stick the fans up\nGo on and get your hands up high\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\nYou might also like\nPost coast to coast gotta dose of every lingo\nThe latest famous 80's baby like the dingo\nWho evaded pushing daisies, dodge bullets like Remo\nRemember like Ginkgo when we used to play bingo\nUsed to be in awe with the pushers and the pimps own\nNow I flip cars like the ribs on the Flintstones\nHaters got mad and as sensitive as shinbones\nHad a Goodyear and my intention is to blimp on\nEven if I'm injured I'm gonna limp into the end zone\nFrom game one to the super like Karrine dome\nThat mean I went to Disney World and you just went home\nIt's Lupe and I ain't from there\nBut they root for the away\nYeah they stunned there\nBeautifully I play\nGatorade the coach and tubas need to play now\nUsually I stay, put em on the roof with more truth for me to say\n\nI keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)\nFace to the future tell it hi (hi)\nEverything is super so is fly (fly)\nCome and stick the fans up\nGo on and get your hands up high\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\nThe laboratory happy for me cause I'm back with my belongings\nFerrari 'bout as red as when Carrie was the prom queen\nThink outside the box like Larry Merchant, Don King\nA glacier in Jamaica or a penguin out in Palm Springs\nYeah, keep em in the air like a swan wing\nAnd Imma keep it magic as a Harry Potter wand swing\nAnd my little shop with my terracotta pot\nYou be talkin' bout your kush, you should come and hear my lawn sing\nSo put them up like a robbery\nA Derrick Rose lob to me\nAnd watch and see I alley-oop it properly\nFootball or volley-b, hock-el-y, or sock-el-y\nYou just get the rock to me\nTry and put me down like Gaddafi over Lockerbie\nI'll lock you in a locker b\nLike Bruce Leroy, locked Johnny in a locker see\nShock is the only thing that 2Pac is toppin' me\nHot as rocket bottoms or Kilauea lava be\n\nI keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)\nFace to the future tell it hi (hi)\nEverything is super so is fly (fly)\nCome and stick the fans up\nGo on and get your hands up high\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh8Embed\nPut one in the air like the king's son\nFor the heir to the kingdom\nThat means I'mma be the king once the king done\nIf he don't wanna leave then I might have to guillotine him\nI sing some but I rap a lot like the king's son\nMicrophone checker all across the board you should king him\nDiamond mine my mind make princesses like king cum\nEvery second worth of thinking\nIs enough to fill three rings like Ringlings\nThat's how I kept it on the air is like a re-run\nAnd kept the kings comin' in obscene sums\nYou see for me it's life or death like a king thumb\nMean something\nThat's why I don't play when I relay like a team run\nAnd treat every single day like a scene one\nOutlook on life like I ain't never seen none\n\nI keep my back to the past tell it bye (bye)\nFace to the future tell it hi (hi)\nEverything is super so is fly (fly)\nCome and stick the fans up\nGo on and get your hands up high\nHigh\nHigh\nHigh\n\nPost coast to coast gotta

(forest)\nOr the forest with the trail in it?\nThat's a sail with a 12 in it\nWater coming through from impalin' it (water come through for me now)\nNothin' left of the boat but my holes\nStill I fill up the world and I float like Haile\nHaile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving\nPoseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving\nI'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float\nBrand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast\n\n\"A qualified man with vision, unmoved by daily selfish interests\nLed to right decisions by his conscience\nIn general, a man who knows from whence he comes\nAnd where he's going will cooperate with his fellow human beings\nHe will not be satisfied with merely doing his ordinary duties\nBut will inspire others by his good example\nYou are being watched by the nation\nAnd you should realize, that you will satisfy it if you do good\nBut on the contrary, you do evil\nIt will lose its hope and confidence in you.\"\n- Selassie\n\nHydrant open wide, on the side of the colonized\nSwimmin' in the street, fell asleep on my mama thighs\nBlockin' out the noise that destroys little boys\nLive enjoy, ships ahoy, get deployed by the rock-a-byes\nD-d-d-deep into the sea of my dreams\nLyin' fall asleep at the feet of my queen\nHawk, I'ma write to the beat of your wings\nPsalm for the Ethiopian King, Haile\nHaile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving\nPoseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving\nI'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float\nBrand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast\nHaile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving\nPoseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving\nI'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float\nBrand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast39Embed\nHaaaaa wuuuuhnnnn\nHaile Selassie ya ya ya hun hunn\n\nHaile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving\nPoseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving\nI'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float\nBrand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast\n\n\"Throughout history, it has been the inaction of those who could have acted\nThe indifference of those who should have known better\nThe silence of the voice of justice when it mattered most\nThis, has made it possible for evil to triumph.\"\n- Selassie, uhh\n\nMan's limitation, transfiguration\nHaka dance done at the welcome to the demo\nModern man comes to the weddin' in the limo\nMixin' doves with the rice rain\nUncle Ben's off the rails on the night train\nAnd that storm took us to the platform, pushas\nBack to the bachelor's backdoor, unhook us\nHope this track take you back to where the fat girl pushed us\nAnd that's very old\nLike Blackberry Bold but the juice\nSweeter than where the party at, or\nReleasing these niggas from the roofs, and\nLeavin' these niggas on the loose, or\nKeepin' these niggas in the coops, and\nLeavin' these niggas on the noose, free!\nShamu fan got a world to see!\n\nHaile Selassie, high as the eyelids of osprey, I'm thriving\nPoseidon, your trident can't stop me, from diving\nI'm looking for my, looking for my, looking for my, as I float\nBrand new shell for my ghost, tattoos all on my coast\n\n\"Then until the philosophy which holds one race superior and another inferior\nIs finally and permanently discredited and abandoned\nThat until there no longer first class and second class citizens of any nation\nUntil the color of a man's skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes.\"\n- Selassie\n\nTo the limit, the limit in the Methadone clinic\nRidin' with the pack like a Peloton\nFlyin' with the sack in the trap like the pregnant\nAs it breaks in the backs from the cracks that we step upon\nIf I triple my worth, will it cripple my mom?\nIf I simple my search, will it mental my calm?\nWill it hurt if I give you my palm?\nTo tell in it, don't put a nail in it\nHow you gonna see the world if you a whale in it\nAnd readin' my palms like there's braille in it (braille in it)\nIs it the trail or the forest?

greatest fear to let the groove slip\nAlways tell the masses that it's never gon' stop\nCause you never gon' do shit\nMagnify justice over long lost blues riffs\nMop up, sop up the tears for fears with a Q-tip\nThey proceeds to poke out they eyes with a toothpick\nRemember when Larenz Tate beat Terrence with the pool stick\nOr when Caine pistol whipped Chauncy and that fool snitched\nSent the tape to Bill Duke, would've went to jail\nIf he wouldn't have got killed in that drive-by by the dude he kicked\nCuz he was like, \"It ain't mine\"\nAnd she was like, \"You the only guy that I do it with\"\n'Member when 'Pac and Q start fightin' over Steel house\nThey broke a vase, Steel screamed, Raheem told 'em to chill out\nThe jheri curl Blood that bumped Ricky eating chips\nThe same guy they was looking for when Ice Cube stopped to let Cuba out the whip\nAnd wan' it sad how Loco had the habit?\nAnd wan' it funny when they caught T-Bone, dancing with that rabbit\nDidn't Rocket have the same gun that the old man shot OG Bobby Johnson's son in the back with\nOr do I got it backwards\nAnd Bobby Johnson was the one that put his fist up to the glass\nAnd Caine put his fist up and dapped it\nChicago and Regina had sex inside the mail truck\nThey left his ass, he reached down to get his hairbrush\nAnd Tr\u00e9 lied to Furious, sitting down getting his hair cut\nYou might also like\nYeah, do you remember these\nDouble burger with cheese\nDouble burger with cheese\nDouble burger with cheese, huh\nDo you remember these\nDouble burger with cheese\nDouble burger with cheese\nDouble burger with cheese\n\nCaine told him as he jacked him at the drive-thru\nA hundred bucks will tell who Radames put the knife to\nAnother hundred for the cop who chased New Jersey Drive crew\nThe group who took Ricky ball, Crip or Piru\nKicked Doughboy, told him he could buy a hundred balls\nLittle Bobby used his bed to iron out his overalls\nWho knew in a few he would have a gun aimed\nAnd Caine'd had a nigga's Daytons skatin' on his Mustang\n'Member when the whole crowd stopped and got tense\nThen they cheered when Steel put his hand up on the fence\nThen when Gee Money

love, but the Pac Man day came\n'Specially after sprayed the little ese with the spray paint\n'Member when Bobby took off his tear\nAnd when Doughboy disappeared\nAfter his brother died and he said nobody cared\nI still do, after all these years\nBecause he should've played ball\nRicky ain't deserve none of that at all\nThese are just a illustration\nOf a few scenes that helped raise a

let the groove slip\nAlways tell the masses that it's never gon' stop\nCause you never gon' do shit\nMagnify justice over long lost blues riffs\nMop up, sop up the tears for fears with a Q-tip\nThey proceeds to poke out they eyes with a toothpick\nRemember when Larenz Tate beat Terrence with the pool stick\nOr when Caine pistol whipped Chauncy and that fool snitched\nSent the tape to Bill Duke, would've went to jail\nIf he wouldn't have got killed in that drive-by by the dude he kicked\nCuz he was like, \"It ain't mine\"\nAnd she was like, \"You the only guy that I do it with\"\n'Member when 'Pac and Q start fightin' over Steel house\nThey broke a vase, Steel screamed, Raheem told 'em to chill out\nThe jheri curl Blood that bumped Ricky eating chips\nThe same guy they was looking for when Ice Cube stopped to let Cuba out the whip\nAnd wan' it sad how Loco had the habit?\nAnd wan' it funny when they caught T-Bone, dancing with that rabbit\nDidn't Rocket have the same gun that the old man shot OG Bobby Johnson's son in the back with\nOr do I got it backwards\nAnd Bobby Johnson was the one that put his fist up to the glass\nAnd Caine put his fist up and dapped it\nChicago and Regina had sex inside the mail truck\nThey left his ass, he reached down to get his hairbrush\nAnd Tr\u00e9 lied to Furious, sitting down getting his hair cut\n\nYeah, do you remember these\nDouble burger

You can't talk 'til you marry me\u201d\n\nThe waves can be your cover, the beach can be your pillow\nMy heart can be your house, my eyes can be your windows\nTo teach you how to swim and then we'll play Nintendo\nBeating all of your friends, dancing to the tempo\nGo Alan, go Alan\nGo Alan, go Alan\nGo Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan\nGo Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, yeah\n\nAnd they say, yeah (now entering)\nNow entering that Canadian Olympic swimming team\nAnd those medals are just glistening, so gold\nSo cold, yeah\nAnd Alan did the most, all those world records he broke\nThat's why his nickname is the lifeguard and my God is he dope\nMichael Phelps cannot believe it even though he is his coach\nHe might be the next Steve Zissou, or maybe Jacques Cousteau\nWhere he saw that little boy, go and fall off of that boat\nSo he jumped off in that water swam him right back to the shore\nNow ain't that wild, crowd goes wild\nLittle boy scared so the child won't smile\nSo Alan get a towel to dry him off and wipe him down\nPut an ice cream out, that's more his style\nFather runs down that beach\nSees his son just playin' in the sand\nHugs Alan who says he's a brave little man\nWalk away little boy, turns around and waves his hand\nCall Jonylah say, \"Guess what I did today?\nGot my rescue on saved a kid today\nHad my wet suit on and my fins today\nEven taught him next time how to swim away\"\nYou should really feel good that you gave your help\nMight get you into heaven, might raise your health\nMight get a lot of blessings, might raise your wealth\nBet you ain't even know that you saved yourself\n\nThe waves can be your cover, the beach can be your pillow\nMy heart can be your house, my eyes can be your windows\nTo teach you how to swim and then we'll play Nintendo\nBe with all of your friends, dancing to the tempo\nGo Alan, go Alan\nGo Alan, go Alan\nGo Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan\nGo Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, yeah\n\nThe waves can be your cover, the beach can be your pillow\nMy heart can be your house, my eyes can be your windows\nTo teach you how to swim and then we'll play Nintendo\nBe with all of your friends, dancing to the tempo\n(Are you scared?)\nGo Alan, go Alan\nGo Alan, go Alan\nGo Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan\nGo Alan, go Alan, go Alan, go Alan, yeah"

steps\nAwkwardly across the kitchen floor to your best\nYour first breaths that we can call words\nWere in your father's lap on November 23rd\nAnd they were, \"Live for me\", and he did for you\nFlipped to Neutron and stayed inside the crib for you\nAnd this commitment from your father\nImparted a deep sense of value you forever harbor\nWe were all so proud as we seen you getting smarter\nAnd the bond grow deeper between a mother and a daughter\n'Cause you were not a martyr\n(You live)\n\nFind out, I was just a bad dream\nGoodbye\n\nAt six, you started reading whole books\nAt seven, you knew how a brain looked\nAnd could roughly describe, all the different regions\nCould tell when we was sick and even knew the reason\nThe world wasn't at peace, gunfire every weekend\nBut you were hardly there, cause you was always leaving\nField museum, planetarium, aquarium\nYou saw something special in that tank you were starin' in\nAnd in those moments, as a little girl\nYou realized there was a bigger world\nBigger than the South Side, bigger than Chicago\nYou were bigger, still wanted rims on your car though\nAnd big ass woofers in your car door\nSo you could wang like your daddy at the park eating sharks\nWent to King where you were teased for being smart\nWhere you bumped into Hadiya teaching art\nYou live forever\nYou might also like\nFind out, I was just a bad dream\nNeither ever, nor never, goodbye\nNeither ever, nor never, goodbye\nNeither\n\nAt sixteen is when you got your scholarship\nAt twenty-two is when you got your doctorate\nEven now it's kind of hard to believe\nBut your father taught you work hard, and achieve\nAnd you complied\nAccepted by every medical school you applied\nBut the coolest thing is when they offered you that high paying slot, you replied\n\"They need me in the hood,\" and that's where you reside\nFree clinic, nobody denied\nAnd that's where you heard the shots and quickly ran outside\nAnd saw a man and a van and a bleeding baby in his hands\nFading fast, but you knew she could survive\nDid everything you could to keep this girl alive\nStabilized until the ambulance arrived\nAnd in that moment, where you gave your help\nI bet you didn't know that you saved yourself\n\nFold down your hands, give me a sign\nHooked on your lies\nYou live, forever\nLay down next to me, don't listen when I scream\nBury your doubts and fall asleep\nLord have mercy8Embed\nYou live, forever\n\nHow 'bout them bullets ain't slow you up?\nYou ain't really died and we watched you grow up\nAt 12 months you took your first

Comedy\nI vibe consciously to override suicide inside\nHonestly 'cause they don't wanna honor me and honesty\nBlack king poetic with Nat King's aesthetic\nHalf-dream, half-machine where the black queens get naked\nFor a dollar from a scholar like me\nNot at all bothered with what a sodomite see, flippant\nA thousand grams get dissolved in the kitchen\nHeart wrenchin', part played, took away from my ascension\nCrooked ways brought from car lookaways from tooken Js\nBut it's too late for your prevention 'cause I'm playin' my position\n\nI'm the man now\nI'm the man, now\nI'm the man,

sins\nSin and swim in my trunk like jumps in deeper ends\nWe the gems, your daughter, we'll teach her hymns\nFrom the annals of crime channels that dismantle her wants for weaker men\nSend 'em back, a livin', I'm feelin' trapped\nWe no religion but brimmin' with brilliant facts\nSo we map cast distorted role of a lady\nWith no control, let her go whole on a baby\nI wanna see it all, never half asleep some niggas can't see the walls\n'Cause of the masterpiece my data breach like hacker leaks\nDelete the McAfees and slam the backdoors in back of me\nSocial engineer, peers stare at it, give a chat to me happily\nActually activated off accolades of my apogee\nAnd act yakkity then deeply speak it back to me\nThen move it further, we can have a junta or a jerga\nI smurf it and spoof the

shorties\nScheme for giant green, getting CREAM sweeter than bein' corny\nKnow the difference between bein' in love and bein' horny\nBein' hated, bein' human, bein' a teen but bein' forty\nThey like to get 'em young like I'm Brigham's son\nBe more man and my attitude' no lad, I'd rather have a youth\nFlag the OGs pullin' Benzos out\nThey make 'em put they pussies out like Fred Flintstone's

   "lyrics": "52 ContributorsAmerican Terrorist III Lyrics\nHello Gorgeous\nThis phone call's probably being recorded\nJust know that I did it for the four of us\nAnd those motherfuckers kept ignorin' us\nAfter this I'm going underground\nIf they come asking give them the run-around\nHow does Costa Rica in the summer sound?\nCouple days then we moving to another town\nYea I know them dreams, seams\nJust know that time'll never come between\nSpace either, fake features\nThings that we reject but connects all us believers\nThe insurrection's gone viral\nThey'll never stop it now, I hope it all spirals\nOutta control, like a dam with a hole\nFrom here on out it's all about survival\nThe way we left things they probably think we rivals\nBut don't be naive, they hate you more than I do\nRemember always speak in opposites\nI hate you so much, it's such a compliment\nI know that defies the common sense\nBut we ain't never been right: honestness\nWe never fit in school, and never did rules\nBut who'd a thought we'd turn out bombing shit\nYou might also like\nI'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel\nI want to drive you through the night down the hills\nI'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear\nI'm gonna show you where it's dark but have no fear\n\nHe said he was just so tired\nOf them fighting our water with fire\nHe said that we need something drier\nTo really impress the empire\nFunny cause he really hated war\nBut why we went to war is what he really hated more\nSaid it's silly how that our schools make us stupid and our jobs make us poor\nWhen he came back from the Corps\nIs when he really got serious\nRead a lot of books, started acting all mysterious\nThe VA is what really made him furious\nTold him his condition didn't exist, period\nThat's why he started that petition\nWent all the way to Washington, said they didn't listen\nTo a white male Christian\nHe just laughed when they took our father's pension\nHe said that you gotta act in opposites\nHelps you hide your tracks when you stand up to the dominant\nBut I knew he felt bad\nTold me later was the saddest day he ever had\nTo see our dad so hopeless\nThat was the turning point that's what really gave him focus\nI didn't agree with everything, some of it made sense\nBut never thought that he would do something like this\nI'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel\nI want to drive you through the night down the hills\nI'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear\nI'm gonna show you where it's dark but have no fear\n\nI know you don't watch but your brother was on TV\nCouple guys in black suits came around to see me\nThey went through all your books and took all of your CDs\nMy granny said you'd be all right, she saw it in the tea leaves\nAll the operations going well, had a lotta contact from all the other cells\nEverybody, everywhere is calling you a hero\nThey going through the rubble, but the body count is zero\nIt's all violent and bloodless\nI know the government really loves this\nThis account is hacked, you know how to keep in touch\nI'll never see you again, I hate you so much\n\nThere's something inside you\nIt's hard to explain\nThey're talking about you boy\nBut you're still the same\n\nI'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel\nI want to drive you through the night down the hills\nI'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear\nI'm gonna show you where it's dark but have no fear10Embed\nHello Gorgeous\nThis phone call's probably being recorded\nJust know that I did it for the four of us\nAnd those motherfuckers kept ignorin' us\nAfter this I'm going underground\nIf they come asking give them the run-around\nHow does Costa Rica in the summer sound?\nCouple days then we moving to another town\nYea I know them dreams, seams\nJust know that time'll never come between\nSpace either, fake features\nThings that we reject but connects all us believers\nThe insurrection's gone viral\nThey'll never stop it now, I hope it all spirals\nOutta control, like a dam with a hole\nFrom here on out it's all about survival\nThe way we left things they probably think we rivals\nBut don't be naive, they hate you more than I do\nRemember always speak in opposites\nI hate you so much, it's such a compliment\nI know that defies the common sense\nBut we ain't never been right: honestness\nWe never fit in school, and never did rules\nBut who'd a thought we'd turn out bombing shit\n\nI'm giving you a nightcall to tell you how I feel\nI want to drive you through the night down the hills\nI'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear\nI'm gonna show you where it's dark but have no fear\n\nHe said he was just so tired\nOf them fighting our water with fire\nHe said that

to hold\nThink I'll be letting you go\nOh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh\nOh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh\n\nMy self portrait shows a man that the wealth tortured\nSelf-absorbed with his own self-forfeit\nA shelf full of awards\nWorshiping the warships that set sail on my sea of life\nWhen I see my old self I wonder if we still see alike\nWe was tight seeing lights, speaking right and breathing life\nNow I see my demons and barely even sleep at night\nI don't get high, life keep me at a decent height\nAs the old me I predicted all my recent plights\nExhausted, trying to fall asleep, lost inside my recent fights\nBurdens on my shoulders now, burnin' all my motives down\nInspiration drying up, motivation slowing down\nYou might also like\nThings are getting outta control\nFeels like I'm running

all these different spirits, livin' off these separate souls\nPoint in life is getting hollow, can't wait for the exit hole\nGive me room the entry wound, let me in and let me go\nSo I can roam around this wilderness\nSee it for what it really is, unprepared and filterless\nMagnify the youth in me, alibi the shootin' spree\nAmplify the revolution, sanitize the lunacy\nStrip away the justice, justify the scrutiny\nI can see the lasers, shootin' out of you and me\nThings are getting outta control\nFeels like I'm running out of soul\nOh-woah-oh-oh, oh-woah-oh-oh\nOh-woah-oh-oh,

MURAL Lyrics\n\"If you had to paint the gutter, which color would you choose?\"\nSaid the patron to the painter, the painter said, \"The blues\"\n\"Do you act off intuition or languish and peruse?\"\n\"More like tap into tradition from the angle of my mood\"\nHe looked back at his canvas while strangling a tube\nA master of the palette, all sanguine and cool\nThe music mostly jazz, the jazz mostly old\nPunctured by some punk and some old smoky soul\nAn atlas on the trunk from the land of broken goals\nJust a cover and a back that you open and you close\n\"Where are all the pages?\" The paint\u0435r said, defanged\n\"I ripped '\u0435m all out and made some paper planes\nFish grease absorbers and some origami cranes\u201d\nPoured hisself a drink and then poured it down the drain\nLooked at the empty canvas, said \"I think I have a name\nI'll call it 'Gasoline Pouring on the Flames,'\" hah, hah\n\n\n\"I appreciate the visit, this isn't normally allowed\"\n\"Do you consider yourself wild or conforming to a style?\"\nThe patron pointed at a pile, \"Are those rejections or mistakes?\"\nThe painter said, \"That is not for question or debate\nMost of what we know as art is the projection of a faith\nThe product of a Pontiff or the election of a saint\nA gift from the read for the digestion of the can't\nA visual garnish for the confessions of the frank\nDisplays of physical carnage make connections to the ranks\nGoes over very well with South Americans and Yanks\nNot to sound shamanistic, but there's medicine in paint\nIt gets kinetic if you let it, there's a fetish in its strength\nMartyrdom will call, Russian roulette is in the flanks\nAnd most would pull the trigger if the weapon's full of blanks\nBut when there's a pool of sharks and you step into the tank\nThat's the pool of art that got 'em headed to the plank\nBut they fell for the deceptiveness of the secularist's complaint\nThe upheaval of the cathedral into the edifice of bank\nThat pile over there is just the evidence of angst\nThe failed revival of a perfectionist when his efforts have just sank\nA selection of the waste that lacks direction or a base\nYou lose all of the plots for the affections of a race\nMan does not become superior 'cause you connect him to a cape\nNor does become inferior because you connect him to a ape\nI never wanted my life to be a collection of some dates\nAnd holiday my days away and intellectually sedate\nIt's not really a beef but conceptually it's steak\nLike do genitals and gender roles successfully conflate?\nThe current art world is just competitively opaque\nIt never ceases to amaze, my mouth is medically agape\nOne day its raising up the brand, the next it's shredding it to flakes\nAnd the velocity of trends is what referees the pace\nProfessionally accept what ethically I hate\nSo in all of my work, you see this wrestling with fate\nDeceiving in the brushstrokes how aggressively I strafe\nLess like putting on some makeup, more like severing a face\"\n\"Wow,\" said the patron with a smile\n\"That's the most interesting diatribe I've heard in a while\nHow you articulated the nature and put it all on trial\nTook it up to Heaven, then put it on the ground\"\nThe painter asked the patron, \"Can you stand up on the pile?\nI've had a flash of inspiration, my creativeness aroused\"\nThe model took its place, the painter grabbed a lighter\nDoused the shit in gasoline and set it all on fire\nYou might also like\nWe got through the hearts of stone\nAnd the scars for bones\nWhen your heart's unknown\nIn the arc of Joan,

drain\nLooked at the empty canvas, said \"I think I have a name\nI'll call it 'Gasoline Pouring on the Flames,'\" hah, hah\n\n\n\"I appreciate the visit, this isn't normally allowed\"\n\"Do you consider yourself wild or conforming to a style?\"\nThe patron pointed at a pile, \"Are those rejections or mistakes?\"\nThe painter said, \"That is not for question or debate\nMost of what we know as art is the projection of a faith\nThe product of a Pontiff or the election of a saint\nA gift from the read for the digestion of the can't\nA visual garnish for the confessions of the frank\nDisplays of physical carnage make connections to the ranks\nGoes over very well with South Americans and Yanks\nNot to sound shamanistic, but there's medicine in paint\nIt gets kinetic if you let it, there's a fetish in its strength\nMartyrdom will call, Russian roulette is in the flanks\nAnd most would pull the trigger if the weapon's full of blanks\nBut when there's a pool of sharks and you step into the tank\nThat's the pool of art that got 'em headed to the plank\nBut they fell for the deceptiveness of the secularist's complaint\nThe upheaval of the cathedral into the edifice of bank\nThat pile over there is just the evidence of angst\nThe failed revival of a perfectionist when his efforts have just sank\nA selection of the waste that lacks direction or a base\nYou lose all of the plots for the affections of a race\nMan does not become superior 'cause you connect him to a cape\nNor does become inferior because you connect him to a ape\nI never wanted my life to be a collection of some dates\nAnd holiday my days away and intellectually sedate\nIt's not really a beef but conceptually it's steak\nLike do genitals and gender roles successfully conflate?\nThe current art world is just competitively opaque\nIt never ceases to amaze, my mouth is medically agape\nOne day its raising up the brand, the next it's shredding it to flakes\nAnd the velocity of trends is what referees the pace\nProfessionally accept what ethically I hate\nSo in all of my work, you see this wrestling with fate\nDeceiving in the brushstrokes how aggressively I strafe\nLess like putting on some makeup, more like severing a face\"\n\"Wow,\" said the patron with a smile\n\"That's the most interesting diatribe I've heard in a while\nHow you articulated the nature and put it all on trial\nTook it up to Heaven, then put it on the ground\"\nThe painter asked the patron, \"Can you stand up on the pile?\nI've had a flash of inspiration, my creativeness aroused\"\nThe model took its place, the painter grabbed a lighter\nDoused the shit in gasoline and set it all on fire\n\nWe got through the hearts of stone\nAnd the scars for bones\nWhen your heart's unknown\nIn the arc of Joan, yeah"

dream on me\nTold that nigga he can lean on me\nFall asleep and have a dream on me\nNigga, yeah yeah yeah yeah\n\nYou see, it takes niggas weeks\nThey need a comfort zone and some beats\nLollygaggers to poly matters that go over responses\nGet all layered and technical in they content\nPress record, then I bring the receipts\nLambda Lambda Lambda, I think that shit was sweet\nI wish I could just kiss you on the cheek\nNerds have they hands in everything\nGangsters won't even touch the police\nWon't you tell your niggas get that\nTake some of those cool fullies and go and get some of our shit back\nYour problem is that you ain't never have no impact\nKit-Kats and chit-chat and syntax won't make up for how much you sit back\nI think that nigga scared\nHe never leave Heaven 'cause he already dead\nDamn, nigga are you insane?\nWhat's the point in knowing how to point and aim\nIf the niggas you gon' bang look exactly the same?\nThat ain't motherfucking cool, that's a motherfucking shame\nThis ain't no motherfucking game\nThat's why I think you are a motherfucking lame\nWe both wear glasses, the difference is\nI was in school thinking it was cool, you was thinking of skipping classes\nListening to your track record, I could see you were skipping classics\nI did it on my first one and delivered to the masses\nYour songs are immemorable, your verses are impenetrable\nI ain't even listen to that diss record\nI only fuck with you 'cause your interviews\nI ain't even trip when you called me a bitch\nI was like, \"Look at Salem, calling me a witch\"\nLook at how they made him, look how much they gave him\nLook at all the assists, nigga, if it wasn't for Premier\nYou wouldn't be, if it wasn't for, if it wasn't for\nIf it wasn't for, if it wasn't for, nigga, I got a dozen more\nHov think I'm Hov, Nas think I'm Nas\nThat's the trick, you ain't gotta think when niggas already think you are\nMuah!\nYour story crooked and your book too, pass the dumb shit\nBut you would shoot somebody's son holding Sun Chips\nI wish they would've left Biz here, and fucking took you\nAnd all your hyper-technical hypotheticals\nIn life, I've never met with you, from a distance, I accepted you\nFrom the podcast, I've been kind of skeptical\nThis ain't our first clash, this is just one of the several\nI ain't trying to bash, but it was like you was off your schedule\nYou was throwing more than jabs, I was like, \"This nigga's incredible\"\nWe had to fucking edit you\nI don't know what vegan Detroit vegetable Dr. Sebi diet infected you\nTo think that we share the same metrics or somehow I was less than you\nAnd I was the type of nigga that you could get really disrespectful to\nI ain't never lectured you, I get energetic and joke\nBut in real talk, nigga, I ain't never disrespected you\nI'ma punch you in your fucking face and we all think it's silly\nI'm thinking like \"Won't this bitch nigga clean up his fucking city?\"\nI mean you got all of the clout, know how to bring all them niggas out\nYou can walk the walk, I mean, we seen you walk all over your house\nBut me and Mickey is geeks because you got some heat\nLike I didn't go to the closet and put guns all over the couch\nYour mental health hotline, I think that shit is grown up\nBut you're the very last nigga that should be picking that phone up\nI spit your verse to get immersed inside my enemy\nAnd to remind you they got to go through you just to get to me\nSubtle subordination\nPerpetual sidekick, nigga sort of a station that you used to\nSo you ain't got to get all extremely too personal on your albums\nWhen you not surrounded by bigger artists to fucking boost you\nNigga, you called me, I didn't recruit you\nBut no regrets, I take it as a test\nYou said, \"Lupe, you gotta have some grace\nNot be so haphazardly to put the truth all in they face\"\nNow that I think about it, that's kind of half-and-half\nIf a nigga asked you for the strap, why would you keep it in the stash?\nIf you ran the world, we'd get defeated in a flash\nYou really gonna be the boss, can't keep secrets from the staff\nI learned that in the streets, nigga sweeping trash\nKeeping my city clean while you was talking 'bout beating a nigga's ass\nThat shit is wack, long live backpack rap\nFuck these Monster-drinking, new-age conscious-thinking\nFarrakhan today, gangster tomorrow\nOne foot in they sorrow, another foot in the trap\nKillers who easily triggered by a little nigga's attacks\nWho have the audacity to ask rappers to rap\nFacts!\nMickey!\nAyy, ayy, listen, I ain't done, nigga\nCheck this shit out, look, ayy\n\nIn seven minutes he did it, if he knew how to freestyle\nHe could've rented Heaven for seven minutes\nAnd been done what needed to be done by the second sentence\nAll these extra innings may come across as master\nBut my impression's apprentice\nYour penmanship has the fingerprints of a gimmick\nAnd affection and the intimacy of impressions of that nigga you friends with\nI ain't gotta say it to say it\nI can't even blame you, the nigga's one of my favorites\nFuck that, back to my status\nAll icy, talk spicy like the House of Atreides\nInwardly successful, and outwardly I've made it\nClearly, if I was a regular rapper, you wouldn't even come near me\nThis nigga think he Siri, the answer to your queries\nWhat's Siri to Steve Jobs? A Budden to Tahiry?\nI'm excessively cheery, promote my niggas' theories\nWhat's an alien to a Pentagon report? I see your brother tryna cheerlead\nThat's what he's supposed to do\nAnd everybody that's fucking close to you\n'Posed to support, push you forth\nAnd calm your black ass down 'cause they ain't put you in The Source\nYou chose violence\nI just wanna know when you gon' respond to Osyris\nAnd go to E.O.Dub, battle in front a judge\nInstead of hitting Smack and tryna entertain the thugs\nCome and fuck with us, nerdsYou might also like2Embed\nSay yeah, 'Trakk\nI apologize man, it was uh, last minute\nSo, me ask for this in advance\nSLR, yeah\nSaid they lean on me\nNiggas tried to dream on

Huh, uh)\nVery beautifully alliterated (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nLittle battle raps for you (Talk to 'em like, c'mon)\nSo come on through\n\nBig eyes looking like skies in binoculars\nTwo nights live, singing by the opera house\nBut not in it, just by it\nSomeone alongside it, a long silence\nA strong, vibrant meditative song of guidance\nDesigned to raise eyelids of blind men, saved assignments\nWith warm regards and age kindness for today's climate\nAnd the vain of gang violence meets the gangs's demises\nAnd it\u2014 bangs! Rises like wings on a plane\nPlus a pilot who can fly it into the eye of Hurricane Iris\nStylish, same shoe in different sizes\nWith evidences of the mileage and the growth\nTop hats and coats\nTuxedos and throats, where the bowties posts\nFolks look past the lower-class blower of the notes\nAnd tell unspoke jokes as they approach\nWhich she'd never be inside, but she hopes\nYou might also like\nI got these (Yeah) really neat (Really neat, really neat)\nVery beautifully alliterated (Very beautiful, uh)\nLittle battle raps for you (Little battle rap, little battle rap, yeah)\nI got these, really neat (Really neat, huh)\nVery beautifully alliterated (Wassup, wassup)\nLittle battle raps for you (Yeah, uh, uh)\nSo come on through\n\nThe unamplified, fantasize land\nOf the soon-to-be fans of the samurai\nSmile wide, got the panorama camera vibe\nIf you analyze, she's a one-woman gala, glamorized\nJust without the glamor or the gala ties\nMet 'em all live with the jazz guys\nEating piano pies at the Vanguard\nShe's a artist and starved\nA couple dollars in the band jar buys a half a turkey sam\nOrganic and it's hand-carved and ours\nIf you ask for a piece, freshly laugh for singing jazz in the streets\nAnd the staff ask for police (Damn)\nCrashed at a friend's flat for a week (For a week)\nFelt as home as a raft on the beach (On the beach)\nLit a fag, took a drag, took a tea (Took a tea)\nRead a book, took a bath, went to sleep\nI got these, really neat (You know what I'm sayin'?

Flow is going almonds\nWe going back to goin' in, you gonna need a Garmin\nThen go and get a car to put your Garmin and my broad in\nDestination everywhere, reputation everywhere\nMusic drop, music stop, one man take up every chair\nI know that that ain't very fair how one man take up everywhere\nBut it ain't for long though, it'll be some closure\nOr maybe I'll be everywhere after I'm all over\nSay goodbye then start the show, fall on off then start to blow\nActing like I'm rapping, it's that Joaquin Phoenix Facebook flow\nFlow is in the microwave, call it Michael Tyson flow\nKilling is a dirty job: Michael Myers, Michael Rowe\nBring it back like Michael Fox, see how far them Michaels go\nI feel like I'm Michael Crichton writin' with a microphone\nI ain't saying you should die but you should leave your life alone\nMaybe borrow one of mine, fast life, life at home\nLife is like a box of chocolates, pockets full of Toblerones\nPocket full of wallets so what continent we shopping on?\nYou might also like\nI'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat (Yeah)\nI'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat (Yeah)\nI'm killin', I'm killin', I'm killin' this beat (Yeah)\nI'm

your conscience\nSupplier of your fire and provider of your content\nThey really don't want none of you, let's put them in a convent\nYou are such a handful, you can call us palm prints\nThey can't get a handle, try to run around my track\nAnd you might get a ham pulled, swag I got a van-full\nPlus a motorcycle and a tow truck my sedan pull\nI am like a Superman, just without the damn \"Youuuu!\"\nFlow is tied around the track, something like a damsel\nFlow is really manly, though, see, that was an example\nRemember that for later, though, because I might exam you\nGet ready for your tests-s-s, his excellence commands you\nSee, that's how I get it done: effortless and ample\nMeans I got a lot of that, no camel toe or Monistat\nNo pussy in my program...\nWorldwide, let 'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans\nPut in my work and punch the clock like Riddick Bowe's hands\nSee, my pot is overflowing, can I put some work in your pan?\nYeah, yeah, I am such a dope man\nKitchen's really happy, you should come and see my stove dance\nMovie of the week, I call it Beauty and the Beast\nAnd that there's just the kitchen, you should see just where I sleep\nCrib is on some other shit, mind is on the mothership\nBrain is on my sister boat, thoughts is in my brother whip\nFitted hat is Reynolds Wrap cause I don't trust the government\nSee, I'm not just touching it, I'm clutching it with oven mitts\nShit get hot, this wristwatch, looks like its a club in it\nLike the way I emcee, man, they just be lovin' it\nUsed to be a pushover, now I'm into shovin' shit\nYou be on your glory hole, you don't know who you fuckin' with\nStay off in that story mode, I never like a quick game\nCame in with a big blast, go out with a big bang\nYou might catch some whiplash every time I switch lanes\nSee, I drive a bit fast, nigga kinda insane\nCareer on stilts, Braveheart: no kilt\nYou can hear it screaming \"freedom\" as the beat get killed\nI'm killin', I'm killin',

you\nI\u2019ll never let you go\nI\u2019ll never forget you\nI\u2019ll always remember, I hope you know\n\nLet the record reflect the records we set\nBest foot forward with every step\nAnd let\u2019s push towards it, never regress\nAnd let\u2019s remember, if ever we get\nDown, the places that we came from \u2019round\nAnd all the good times on the bad side of town\nThe upside of bad, flip it upside down\nCame from the bottom but we up high now\nBelieve, and from this view we achieved\nWe looked back at the rules we received\nAnd how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those\nAnd the ghost still alive in the photos\nSounds of the summer, day and go wise\nCold wind blowin\u2019 through a city on fire\nMoments of the past, came here to find you\nNot to relive them, just to remind you\nYou might also like\nTake me to that old familiar place\nTake me to memories we won\u2019t erase\nTake me to all that we had\nGood and the bad\nI\u2019ll never forget you\nI\u2019ll never let you go\nI\u2019ll never forget you\nI\u2019ll always remember, I hope you know\n\nAnd let the evidence show, the future\u2019s so bright\nIt\u2019s never been more, not like tonight\nWe walk into the glow, right into the light\nThe past all around us, the time of our life\nThe first love kisses, the broke heart disses\nThis is just like a first-class ticket\nBack, to the first written rap\nThe crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap\nThe hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat\nThe hookers on the corner and the kids sellin\u2019 crack\nThe needles in the yard where we used to play

remember, I hope you know\n\nLet the record reflect the records we set\nBest foot forward with every step\nAnd let\u2019s push towards it, never regress\nAnd let\u2019s remember, if ever we get\nDown, the places that we came from \u2019round\nAnd all the good times on the bad side of town\nThe upside of bad, flip it upside down\nCame from the bottom but we up high now\nBelieve, and from this view we achieved\nWe looked back at the rules we received\nAnd how we broke those, dismantled and rewrote those\nAnd the ghost still alive in the photos\nSounds of the summer, day and go wise\nCold wind blowin\u2019 through a city on fire\nMoments of the past, came here to find you\nNot to relive them, just to remind you\n\nTake me to that old familiar place\nTake me to memories we won\u2019t erase\nTake me to all that we had\nGood and the bad\nI\u2019ll never forget you\nI\u2019ll never let you go\nI\u2019ll never forget you\nI\u2019ll always remember, I hope you know\n\nAnd let the evidence show, the future\u2019s so bright\nIt\u2019s never been more, not like tonight\nWe walk into the glow, right into the light\nThe past all around us, the time of our life\nThe first love kisses, the broke heart disses\nThis is just like a first-class ticket\nBack, to the first written rap\nThe crumbled-up paper and the pen with no cap\nThe hand-me-down clothes and the unturned hat\nThe hookers on the corner and the kids sellin\u2019 crack\nThe needles in the yard where we used to play catch\nStories from the project we could never go at\nOr to, these are shades of my youth\nTrials of a child, everything truth\nMoments of the past, comin\u2019 back to find us\nNot to relive them, just to remind us\n\nTake me to that old familiar place\nTake me to memories we won\u2019t erase\nTake me to all that we had\nGood and the bad\nI\u2019ll never forget you\nI\u2019ll never let you go\nI\u2019ll never forget you\nI\u2019ll always remember, I hope you know\n\nEverything cherished, remembered in my heart\nSo you will never perish, you will never part\nI tell \u2018em all about you, drummin\u2019 in the park\nWe put you in the ground, but I see you

Lyrics\nReally?\nThis is what you guys been doing?\nSeriously?\nBefore daybreak there were none\nAnd as it broke there was one\nFrom moon to sun, it goes on and on\nThe winter battle was won\nThe summer children were born\nAnd so the story goes on and on\nCome on woman in your life beats\nThose we buried with the house keys\nSmoke and feather where the fields are green\nFrom here to eternity\nBecome a woman in your own time\nFar, far, far from the virgin vine\nRise on out from the dead leaves\nCome back to me\nOh, she sings her favorite song\nLeft with tears and dreams, it goes and then on\n\nStanding in line for the new one\nNot the black, but the blue one\nAnd I don't even know what it do, son\nBut Steve Jobs said that it's too fun\nFun in abundance what I need\nIt's cold out here, put my arms in the sleeves\nI'll probably lose my place if I leave\nBut I really need to pee\nIf I do it right here they'll see\nMakes you wonder, how do snipers\nMarathon bikers\nNext time: diapers\nThey say it has all new features\nFaster processors and much better speakers\nGreat for kids, a necessity for teachers\nFor work or home\nA revolutionary way of being alone\nI mean, should we really get a loan?\nHey what's the matter, just tell it to your phone\nCupertino heart with Chinese parts\nBuilt by the poor, but designed by the smart\nThey opening the door so you go\nOn your mark, get ready, set, buy\nImagine a world where everything starts with an \u2018i\u2019\nBut it still ends with a die\nProbably got an app for that, you could try\nFrom the iClouds, right into the great Wi-Fi\nSiri, can iGod really hear me?\n\"Does not compute\u2014can you repeat more clearly?\"\n\"Woaaaaah\"\nYou might also like\nA vessel in the bloodline\nA thirteenth Zodiac sign\nA stitch in time, it goes on and on\nBecome a woman on your own time\nFar, far, far from the virgin vine\nRise on out from the dead leaves\nCome back to me\nOh, she sings her favorite song\nLeft with tears and dreams, it goes and then on\n\nStanding in line for some new Ones\nHad a bunch of blessings but I blew them\nAsked Google how to use them\nThey sent me to a section \u2018bout used guns\nNew runs, nuns'll scream, moms with jeans\nMatch their teens' jeans and genies who try to chew gum\nAw man, it's so confusin\u2019\nConfusion in abundance what I have\nGood thing that God accept cash\nMaybe buy my way up out His wrath\nSkeptically, why am I way up off this path?\nAtheism's cheaper, and accepts Visa\nMy thoughts as I'm queuing up for sneakers\nWon't discriminate \u2013 I\u2019m getting all eight\nIn every color that they make\nBeaverton hearts with Chinese parts\nBuilt by the poor and designed by the smart\nOn your mark, get set, cop \u2018em!\nImagine a life that revolves around shoppin\u2019\nConspicuous consumption\nThat means it serves no other function\nBut to show off to someone, or others\nWho only try to show off to you \u2013 look at your fellow loyal customers\nIsn't harmony great?\nLook at all these friends that marketing makes\nHow many fries can these arteries take?\nI'll give McDonald's a little help here\nI think they should expand into healthcare\nAnd then you'll have all ends covered\nEven make caskets, have it all umbrella'd\nCan you make the corporation fear me?\n\"Couldn't hear your order, can you speak less clearly?\"\nThat which was put in the ground\nWill someday come back around\nFrom dust to dust it goes on and on\nBefore daybreak there were none\nAnd as it broke there was one\nAnd still the story goes on and on8Embed\nReally?\nThis is

Mazinger Z is clad in ultra alloy Z and is operated by photo atomic energy. It contains mighty weapons of all kinds. That robot is perfect. There is nothing to correct or adjust.

dark hearts and the chasms\nSo big up your chest\nLike a skin teet in a bad man wagon\nNo fear, me a duppy assassin\nMake a wish me a dutchie Aladdin\nWah dem i-sire for dem earthstrong?\nGive thanks to the first Gong\nDi man word like a bird song\nIya self me a work pon (Fyah!)\nMe gon tell ya bout the nation\nGravelicious men in them wicked navigations\nSmall up the slaves and stuff them in

under as a swallow, Wadjet wallows\nInstead he looks for Yetis in tomorrow\nAnd do-gooders become regretters for giving garble\nAt the art show out in Park Slope\nBroken dancers rather flatten cardboards than work at Arco\nFlippers who feat feets riff contortionists hips and grease slippers\nTweezers release slivers\nFrom lines with deep splinters, paws for sweet skippers\nAnother key-figure's of East River's who eat liver and drink liquor\nAnd root for Bird due to an unconscious urge to beat niggas\nWho prefer sweet, steep sleep\nAnd to pull hoes with the ease of police triggers\nSikhs at the hair show, Arabs at the airport\nCaucasians in the projects, niggas anywhere though\n\nPeople lovingly exclaim\nPeople lovingly exclaim\nPeople lovingly exclaim\nPeople...\nYou might also like\nBeauty is the largest\nObstacle to obsess\nDecorate the sergeant\nCommunity resistance in progress\n\nPull out game strong like the Waco Kid\nBut also like a lifeguard, now that don't even make no sense\nBut since, if the swimmers ain't got no rings on\nDon't be a fag, let me stab that Yoo-Hoo with my ding-dong\nFruits of interracials, my banana's bigger than King Kong\nBoth ways seem wrong like nobody in China is good at ping-pong\nSeem wrong?\nThat's evidence they shouldn't be passing their genes on\nThat was racist, but I'ma run with it\nLike every sagging pair of pants has to have a gun in it\nSo I undid it, like a Singapore with gum in it\nDoes that mean if I let you ride it, I can put my thumbs in it?\nUhn\u2014nasty, but let the moment pass, only wave if they ask\nAnd catch me at the scene of the crash, karma\nThey hate blood like Blade\nSo they hate cuz like an English teacher grades\n\nBeauty is the largest\nObstacle to obsess\nDiaspora and sonnets\nCommunity resistance in progress\nPeople lovingly exclaim\nPeople lovingly exclaim\nPeople lovingly exclaim\nPeople...\n\nThe city: population control, occupation parole\nHope the swayed persuades and this conversation cajoles\nNot to be Enron\nAlexander Hamilton of Cassandra's Agamemnon\nThe environment is more than just a panda at the wind farm\nLooks cool but it's bull as cool fusers\nAnd the abusers fuel the duel losers\nTo make fools of the schools and pool Bueller's\nThe crusade to legislate oxygen\nAnd put it in a box just like Desiree Washington\nFortune cookie, First Panda accelerated profit\nAnd hope Santa fill my socks with highly-decorated moccasins\nMy, how the roles have reversed\nSo now we gotta eat 'em for dessert\nBop the kids just to free 'em from the curse\nDress up the thots in lingerie and feed 'em to Levert (uh-huh)\n\nBeauty is the largest\nOrganize the objects\nDiaspora and sonnets\nCommunity resistance in progress\nDiaspora and sonnets\nCommunity resistance in progress\nWoah\u2014the people lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)\nPeople lovingly exclaim (people lovingly exclaim)\nPeople lovingly exclaim (people lovingly

down)\n\nLife Aquatic, product of the passage, ooh\nStay there with me, lookin' like Atlantis (ayy)\nWe're off to build another planet (ayy)\nSee a ship and then we\u2019re really goin' savage (ayy)\nFrom the home, we was lost in the Atlantic\nI wouldn't make it, but we'll find a way to manage (ayy)\nTitanic when we're breakin' off the damage\nI ain't gotta say it man, that wave is automatic\nMe and my partnas, say your life is a beach, no\nBut life is a beach though\nYeah, it's down here on the sea floor (yeah)\nAnd now we\u2019re really gettin\u2019 deep though\nI feel I'm golden (no)\nI don\u2019t take shit from no one (no)\nI just be floatin'\nWe're down in the ocean\nYou might also like\nFish is my friends and the whales is my homies\nOctopuses my people, the shrimp,

nothin'\nBut the sharks and the dolphins gonna do somethin'\nWalked up out that water, evolution\nAyy, ayy, revolution\nPass the plate, you should make a contribution\nIf you ain't got it then you gotta go and get it\nClimate change, chain flooded, call it sleepin' with the fishes\nTired of all these bitches, in my net it's just fishes\nIn my net it's just swishes, boom\nAnd you know I'm a floater, ballin'\nCoachin' from the ark, Doc Rivers, call Flipper my nigga\nSay you got it for the low (low)\nSay you got it by the boat (by the boat)\nWhen you whip it in the water (whip it, whip
