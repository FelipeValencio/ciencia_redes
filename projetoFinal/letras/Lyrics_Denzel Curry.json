  "plain": "Denzel Rae Don Curry, formally known as Denzel Curry, was born in Carol City, Florida on February 16, 1995. He is of Bahamian and Native American descent.\n\nHe started rapping in 6th grade and frequently challenged others to rap battles at a local Boys & Girls club. He attended Miami\u2019s Design And Architecture High School for his first two years of high school before being expelled. He went on to attend Carol City High School while he worked on what would become his debut album, Nostalgic 64.\n\nThroughout 2011-2012, he posted various amateur mixtapes on SoundCloud and DatPiff such as King Remembered in 2011 and Strictly For my R.V.I.D.X.R.Z in 2012, which grabbed the attention of Earl Sweatshirt.\n\nNot long after the group disbanded, he joined SpaceGhostPurrp\u2019s group Raider Klan. After several disagreements between Purrp and Denzel, he would leave the group and, simultaneously, start his solo rap career, alongside the release of his SpaceGhostPurrp\u2019s 2016 diss-track, \u201cPURRPOSELY.\u201d\n\nHis debut album Nostalgic 64 was released in September 2013, and was followed by a double-sided EP in June 2015 titled 32 Zel/Planet Shrooms, which included the gold-certified and breakout hit single, \u201cULTIMATE.\u201d\n\nHis last release before a hiatus was his second studio album/mixtape hybrid, Imperial, which was released in March 2016.\n\nOn July 17, Denzel released his critically acclaimed third studio album, TA13OO, which was divided into three acts, released period 3 days of the complete album: \u201cLight,\u201d released on July 15; \u201cGray,\u201d released on July 16; and \u201cDark,\u201d released on July 17, alongside the entire album \u2014 After its release, it became his first charting album worldwide, peaking at #28 on the Billboard 200, and received generally positive reviews.\n\nAlmost a year after releasing the project, on May 31, 2019, Curry dropped his fourth studio album, ZUU, dedicated to his life in Carol City and inspired by the Miami culture, including features from Rick Ross, Kiddo Marv, Sam Sneak or Ice Billion Berg, the album has two supporting singles, his gold-certified single \u201cRICKY\u201d and \u201cSPEEDBOAT.\u201d\n\nOn February 7, 2020, Denzel would team up with his frequent collaborator and friend, Kenny Beats to release their collaborative\u00a08-track project, UNLOCKED, and exactly one year later, on March 5, 2021, UNLOCKED 1.5, a re-edition of the project was released.\n\nNearly three years later after his latest album, on March 25, 2022, Denzel released what would be his evolution musically than he usually has, with his fifth studio album, Melt My Eyez, See Your Future \u2014 The 14-track album would have 3 promotional singles during its rollout: \u201cWalkin,\u201d \u201cZatoichi\u201d with slowthai, and \u201cTroubles\u201d with veteran rapper T-Pain."

to college for a free throw (Swish)\nPeople gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)\nHave your money up before you go to war (Hmm)\nPut the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)\nMy dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24\nBig talk, speedboat (Speedboat)\nPray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)\nDidn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)\nPeople gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)\nHave your money up before you go to war (Hmm)\nPut the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)\nMy dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24\n\nPourin' out scotch\nGas, all in my brain, it fumigated my thoughts\nThinking 'bout intricate plots\nTo get out the hood, that's when I started to jot\nNot givin' the opportunity to let the devil ruin me, no\nEven though the jewelry froze, ice cubes get Deeboed\nWord on the street, everything heat\nEverything hot boy, Texas Pete\nPulled up in a Lexus and a Jeep\nAll black, no tag, time for the sweep\nToo many guns, too many sons\nLost in the river of blood in these streets\nMaster of none, pastors and nuns\nLet's bow our heads for the ceremony\n\nJesus, please deliver us from evil\nPlease pray over all my people\nWhat you see in life's illegal\nI don't wanna use my desert eagle\n\nBig talk, speedboat (Speedboat)\nPray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)\nDidn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)\nPeople gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)\nHave your money up before you go to war (Hmm)\nPut the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)\nMy dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24\nBig talk, speedboat

crown with me\nThe king's den\nBreak your nexus and your neck 'cause\nEverybody's on your head\nOoh, yeah, he mad\nI'm racking up white diamonds\nThrow me in the sky\nYou would swear the sun

yuh\n\nUnderground utopia, dynasties and dystopia\nFear is never a option, so dying's not a real phobia\nI'm beating the odds\nRising to every occasion as if I defeated the gods\nSwitch up the mod\nNothing but champions comin' up rolled up in one little squad\n\nHold still while I bag that, uh\nTalk bad 'til I snap back, uh\nThis ain't brown, this that dark black\nThis that pitch black, jet black\nSnap yo' ex watch me give him flashbacks\n\nPressure's rising fast as lighting, they can't stop it now\nIf you ain't talking realness, then just change the topic now\nThey laughing at the top like they can't see the bottom\nAnd they thought I needed help, but I got here without them\nI am sharper than a pack of hundred razor blades\nWhen the smoke clears, outta here, bet they name gon' fade\nI'ma be here doing it, doing it my way\nThey said I should I change it up\nBut what did I say?\n\nOoh, yeah, he mad\nI'm racking up white diamonds\nThrow me in the sky\nYou would swear the sun shining\nOoh, yeah, he mad\nI'm racking up white diamonds\nThrow me in the sky\nYou would swear the sun shining\n\nHold still while I bag that, uh\nTalk bad 'til I snap back, uh\nThis ain't brown this

stones getting thrown\nMy temptations are amplified when I get alone\nTried to separate the action from the man\nI wholeheartedly understand why I need to grow even though I'm grown\nIf I did you wrong, I vow to make it right\nJudg\u0435 me off appearance, it was said to m\u0435, I'm impolite\nEyes remain in freeze mode, I'm stuck in fight-or-flight\nI'm deflecting my daily problems within my daily life\nRecognize hidden patterns of my own demise\nWhy I feel like hiding a truth is finding a lie?\nDealt with thoughts of suicide, women I've objectified\nCouldn't see it through my eyes so for that, I apologize\nI'm just hypnotized, working hard to empathize\nStrung out on love addiction and groupies when souls collide\nI've been this way since the day I turned six\nI've been touched

to change\nHad to journal my journey and mistakes I made on the way\nManipulation to get what I want\nGetting very distant after I got what I need\nWriting rap and wisdom, whiskey, women, wars and weed\nNarrating all these conflicts, then top it off with greed\nI keep walkin', I keep walkin', I keep walkin'\nMe and my so-called best friends don't speak often\nBlaming me for everything when they can't point fingers at they selves, so be grateful I offered the help\nBeing aware is my definition of melt\nMy eyes see imperfections within myself\nCracked images, bad luck, and broken mirrors\nFunny how I see in permanent so clearer\nI dedicate this to the ones I hurt\nIt's time to get my spirit right on earth\nBefore my sins become a evil curse\nConquer thirst, can't revert to who I was at first\nI channel God through this verse\nAccountability, I take responsibility\nFor all my actions, I packed them in these soliloquies\nJust because we're not friends don't mean we're enemies\nThank you all for listening, sending y'all with good energy\nSee Denzel Curry LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nMelt\nI keep walkin', I keep walkin', I keep walkin'\nI keep

guns on you\nHoes wanna fuck because you carry funds on you\nLike a blind man in church homie I don't see none of that\nStill can't believe that I made it off rapping\nBaby bottle blue mic spitting blue magic\nHow the fuck the rap game become a beauty pageant?\nFugazi ass rapper trying to sound like Atlanta\nCause they got no identity, I'm off the top like\nO-Ren Ishii vs. Uma Thurman\nGasoline, in my thermos and I'm 'bout to make a furnace out you niggas\nSpitting ether, make-believers call it Easter\nI am Jesus with a blacker penis, that is fucking genius\nWho said Jesus can't be a black guy?\nEven Luke Skywalker's father was on the dark side\n\nStory with no title, everything is vital\nPraying for my rivals let the church say (ay!)\nEverything is vital, hand up on the rifle\nSend them off to Lotto, let the case say (spray!)\nStory with no title, everything is vital\nPraying for my rivals let the church say (ay!)\nEverything is vital, hand up on the rifle\nJust like a\nSee Denzel Curry LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nStory with no title, everything is vital\nStarted from the bottom where they wear bikini bottoms\nDig even deeper you see is crabs in a bucket\nWhen shit hit the fan niggas up it like \"fuck it\"\nSpitting colder shit over cold shit my diamond you cold bitch\nYou like N64 go buy my old shit\nI keep a AK on my Issa Gold shit\nThat's how it goes down on the lower East Coast bitch\nSouth Florida 21 getting older mind of a marine ever since I was a teen\nBlowing up smithereens, living a broke man's dream\nFollow the roots of the prince 'til they crown me king\nIt seems, these niggas acting less than G's\nThis ain't the place that I choose to be\nWhere friends become strangers\nEverybody wants to be a gangsta\nIt's going down on the block, no anchor, story with no title!\n\nStory with no title, everything is vital\nPraying for my rivals let the church say (ay!)\nEverything is vital, hand up on the rifle\nSend them off to Lotto let the case say (spray!)\nStory with no title, everything is vital\nPraying for my rivals let the church say (ay!)\nEverything is vital, hand up on the rifle\nJust like a\nStory with no title, bullet with no name\nI was brought up inside a city that was built off cane\nEven during my sunny days I am still a hurricane\nI just wanna make it rain ain't no aim ba-bay\nWatching Bebe's kids, we all Bebe's kids\nLittle badass jits that's where the story begins\n'Fore the end of the timeline, on to the crimes rise\nOut here beefing ain't no working at Five Guys\nIt's wild, convicted felon put on trial\nIt's sad, a mother outlives her child\nAnd that's bad, especially because we're black\nWhen the revolution start that's when the niggas attack\nI'm looking at the liars that say you ain't come from riches\nStop calling our women bitches, fried chicken and watermelons\nNot my diet, I\u2019m everything you fear and what defines it\nAnd if I die today it's not surprising, story with no title11Embed\nStory with no title, everything is vital\nCame up in this game now my idols is my rivals\nChildhood friends end up pulling guns on you\nHoes wanna fuck because you carry funds on you\nLike a blind man in church homie I don't see none of that\nStill can't believe that I made it off rapping\nBaby bottle blue mic spitting blue magic\nHow the fuck the rap game become a beauty pageant?\nFugazi ass rapper trying to sound like Atlanta\nCause they got no identity, I'm off the top like\nO-Ren Ishii vs. Uma Thurman\nGasoline, in my thermos and I'm 'bout to make a furnace out you niggas\nSpitting ether, make-believers call it Easter\nI am Jesus with a blacker penis, that is fucking genius\nWho said Jesus can't be a black guy?\nEven Luke Skywalker's father was on the dark side\n\nStory with no title, everything is vital\nPraying for my rivals let the church say (ay!)\nEverything is vital, hand up on the rifle\nSend them off to Lotto, let the case say (spray!)\nStory with no title, everything is vital\nPraying for my rivals let the church say (ay!)\nEverything is vital, hand up on the rifle\nJust like a\n\nStory with no title, everything is vital\nStarted from the bottom where they wear bikini bottoms\nDig even deeper you see is crabs in a bucket\nWhen shit hit the fan niggas up it like \"fuck it\"\nSpitting colder shit over cold shit my diamond you cold bitch\nYou like N64 go buy my old shit\nI keep a AK on my Issa Gold shit\nThat's how it goes down on the lower East Coast bitch\nSouth Florida 21 getting older mind of a marine ever since I was a teen\nBlowing up smithereens, living a broke man's dream\nFollow the roots of the prince 'til they crown me king\nIt seems, these niggas acting less than G's\nThis ain't the place that I choose to

me now\nI cannot love 'cause it hurts me\nI will be happy when I see the sun drown\nI have transformed to the worst me\nInfinite words couldn't curse me now\n\nEverything is backwards mother's saying that I'm sinning\nClose my eyes and say, \"Forgive me\"\n'Cause I know the devil ain't\nDevil told my mother in the end that he'll be winning\n'Cause the world is full of sinning\nNo, your son is not a saint\nSpirit of God and the holy ghost, it was written in anecdotes\nThat a snake would try to corrupt what he create\nSick of facades and the horoscope, I devour the antidote\nTold my mother that I was spirited away\nMonstrosity murdering masterpieces, I'm mutilated\nFalling forever, fear and forsaken, incinerated\nInnocence inferno when I'm no longer incubated\nWelcome to the world whenever I'm reincarnated\nRelyin' on the last breath, but y'all would never know\nRewind it to the last step, play me when I'm below\nIf heaven's set on fire, that's the day they make hell snow\nThe devil want my soul and yet I'm tellin' him, \"Hell no\"\nIt's still like death\nSee Denzel Curry LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nIt's like my world is reversing\nEven the pain couldn't hurt me now\nRewind the good to the worst things\nEven my love has deserted me now\nI cannot love 'cause it hurts me\nI will be happy when I see the sun drown\nI have transformed to the worst me (The worst me)\nInfinite words couldn't curse me now\n\nEverything is backwards ever since the new beginning\nGod has given me the vision so that I can see my fate\nBlind can't lead the blind and if we try, then we'll be spinnin'\nIn a cycle in position, try to find a better place\nLucifer, devil, the anti-christ taking light up out of my life\nIn the darkness, it seems to me there's no escape\nInitially alter it into dark, place the pain inside of a pot\nAnd then bury it in a spot where I decay\nIt's death before dishonor, I'm a hideous disfigurement\nWho dying from the envious evil trapped in Floridians\nCame from the Vatican, kill off the advocate\nFeeling inadequate, when a bitch nigga bleed\nWon't even make it to see 23 years, fuck it, I don't wanna be\nHere, look at the time when I'm turnin' it back\nOn the clock and  my right hand makin' it tick\nLife is a bitch, better yet, it's a pit\nAnd my hatred is everyday making you sick\nRegurgitated, early stages, earn the hatred\nBurn the sages, caught in mazes\nInstigated, inspiration, imitations\nOnly here, reanimated, damn\nIt's like my world is reversing (Reversing)\nEven the pain couldn't hurt me now\nRewind the good to the worst things (The worst things)\nEven my love has deserted me now\nI cannot love 'cause it hurts me (Hurts me)\nI will be happy when I see the sun drown\nI have transformed to the worst me

display visions of a way\nFor Heaven on Earth and hell on Earth to fight for night and day\nApocalyptic hoes conflict against my optimistic hopes\nThe ropes around my neck are golden chains for me to choke\nMy locs reflect the locks and the flames that burn across\nIn my very nation, I walk with my peers, surrounded by chalk\nDeities and darkness meetin' at my dinner table\nDeeper than rap, my life is real, this is my mystic fable\nPlay the bad guy just to finish the race first\n'Cause the last guy was nice, but he end up dying of thirst\n\nI'm seein' illusions in the pockets of my brain\nI

you could know that I'm funky as ever\nLike Zero, the pain is down to hill, my brain is made of steel\nI crash into your soldiers like bricks thrown by Shaquille O'Neal\nThe coldest flow in the snow globe, my nigga, I'm lost in frost\nI never went to college, don't even listen to Asher Roth\nSometimes I'm a butterfly, most times I feel like a moth\nKill my insecurities because they tried to make me soft\nKill off, you and your posse, if you cross me\nHave you so shook you wouldn't even want to cross streets\nPardon me\u2014niggas be Madison Square-guardin' me\nYou could be a statue and you still won't be as hard as me\nFuck the industry, I only worry about my artistry\nHard to see, R.I.P. my older brother, Lotto Tree\nDawg, I'm murdering everything inside my allegory\nCome back from the dead, I'll smack you to purgatory\n\nBecause you cannot fuck with Zeltron 6 Bill-ion!\nYou lookin' at my zoom, my shit is Sicil-ian!\nY'all lookin' at my bitch, my bitch is Brazil-ian!\nI'm finna run

got 'em twistin' on them D's watching\nSpeaking facts like 360 degrees drop it\nWisdom, you think you mobbin' but you isn't\nMiami back to Richmond back to Cali\nThey gon' find your body in the alley\nUgly still the ugliest, Ugly still destructive\nI'ma lay you down underneath the ground if you fuck with this\nHead up in the clouds when the dutch is lit, puffin' it\nI be acting foul for the fuck of it\nLately it's a lot of days I feel hopeless (fuck it)\nIt's a lot of days I'm feeling like I'm drowning in the ocean\nPut your hands on me and your hands gettin' broken\nWhen I hit the scene, it's like a goddamn explosion\nFind me out surrounded by some shooters, they be young and old\nPiffing looking crispy I got origami money folds\nUgly Mane, bars played, that blood in my veins be running cold\nRunning the game I be unopposed, short fuse, don't cut it close\nUgly Mane, bars played, that shit I spit be so morose\nYou better watch your mouth playa, I hit you with that lethal dose\n\nBecause you cannot fuck with Zeltron 6 Bill-ion!\nYou lookin' at my zoom, my shit is Sicil-ian!\nY'all lookin' at my bitch, my bitch is Brazil-ian!\nI'm finna run through to the city and kill

   "lyrics": "46 ContributorsMystical Virus Pt. 3: The Scream Lyrics\n\nGold bullet that's trapped in his temple\nWas just the beginning of a deranged mental\nThe mind wasn't simple, the man wasn't gentle\nThey bust out the brain but got caught in the dimple\nTo bust out the dental, the tooth full of wisdom\nWith black on black tints, they jet in the rental\nThe young mane hearing the whisper of Sindel\nWith a gift since birth, if you answer this riddle: Who I be?\nThe fetus of a demon\nSemen from the tip\nOf the penis I'm the only thing\nThat you see when you're dreaming\nArmageddon and aftermath\nThis may blog in paragraphs\nSit on a throne, full of X's and bones\nBlowing smoke and I laugh\nTurning sinners like you\nInto my personal acid tabs\nLet me put you up on game\nI've been shot, burned, and stabbed, and\nStill ain't deceased\nI carry the mark of the beast\nNow can you tell me\nWho the fuck I be?\nDamien, as the kid replies\nWine, red wine was the color of his eyes\nCoughing a lot of blood like Piru, but he slowly dies\nAs his eyes close shut, in prison was his eternal life\nSee Denzel Curry LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nAnd now that nigga scream like he Sindel\nYelling 'suicide' in his prison cell\nRunning with them demons since the age of 12\nLife's never a game, watch him cut his vein\nAnd now that nigga scream like he Sindel\nYelling 'suicide' in his prison cell\nRunning with them demons since the age of 12\nLife's never a game, watch him cut his vein\n\nHe thought he wanted seven digits, the thickest bitches, the top position\nTried to make a profit off the poverty he lives in\nAtrocities committed on the blocks that he got kids in\nAnd now he pops prescriptions, he's in prison to suspicions\nHe fucked the Devil's daughter, now he pissed away forgiveness\nOnly sounds he hears are shots popping in the distance\nThinking that they coming, now he haunted by these visions\nHe knows that there's a dark, and a light, but he don't know the difference\nHe used to run around bangin', man, he love the shit\nAnd now he sit around, waitin' for his punishment\nCops on some old beef, that's why he gotta hold heat\nHe's stuntin' like his daddy, even pops had the gold teeth\nBut pops went to prison back in '03\nSo lil man never got to listen to a OG\nNever got to tell him other options that you don't see\nSo lil man grew up thinking prison where he supposed to be, Ugly\nAnd now that nigga scream like he Sindel\nYelling 'suicide' in his prison cell\nRunning with them demons since the age of

watch him cut his vein\n\nFor the scene, see the best is never seen\nThey say I lack in appearances, but they lack in experience\nI remain quiet like I'm in constant meditation\nOnly way to get in my place is expert and constant observation, nigga\nNever compete, much less be winner at it\nSeven days a week, I found my sinister\nI control my perimeter, patrol isn't giving up\nEvery effort you attempt never amounts to enough\nThey talk around you, but you know you can't give in\nAnd you part of the system, so they treat you just like them\nEvery action is countered, so just don't disturb my zen\nEvery student with honor knows you must deserve lessons, yeah\nI roll with what every character should have\nThat's why I'm equipped with a black suit and mask, I blast\nNow it's silent like when
