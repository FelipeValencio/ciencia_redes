  "plain": "Terrence Thornton (born May 13, 1977), better known by his stage name Pusha T, is an American hip hop recording artist from Virginia Beach, Virginia. He served as the President of Kanye West\u2019s G.O.O.D Music label from 2015-2022.\n\nPusha-T entered the game in 1999 with his brother No Malice (Gene Thornton) as Clipse on \u201cThe Funeral\u201d from Exclusive Audio Footage. While the album was scrapped, this didn\u2019t faze the pair, who went on to release Lord Willin', Hell Hath No Fury, and Till The Casket Drops in the space of seven years. In 2009, No Malice announced he had become a born-again Christian and couldn\u2019t rap about his former lifestyle any longer. This forced Pusha to go solo.\n\nHe was invited to attend Kanye West\u2019s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy sessions in Hawaii in 2010 and later signed to West\u2019s G.O.O.D. Music imprint. In November of 2015, Pusha-T was appointed by Kanye West to be the new President of G.O.O.D. Music.\n\nSince being signed to G.O.O.D Music, T released Fear of God, Fear of God II: Let Us Pray, Wrath of Caine, and My Name Is My Name. His sophomore solo album, titled Darkest Before Dawn was released on December 18, 2015. In 2018, he released his critically acclaimed 3rd studio album DAYTONA, which was executive produced by Kanye West.\n\nPusha T has described his music as being  \u201chigh taste level, luxury, street hip hop [that\u2019s] lyric-driven.\u201d He further elaborated that he\u2019s \u201calways trying to recreate an emotion and a feeling that resonates in the streets.\u201d\n\nPusha has an intricate style of rhyming, typically coupling up to four bars together with dense wordplay. His delivery was faster and sharper in his Clipse days since he only ever rapped 16 bars. Once he went solo, Pusha\u2019s delivery changed significantly. His favorite rappers are The Notorious B.I.G. and Big Daddy Kane who he cites as influences \u2013 and has a knack of working with the industry\u2019s best producers. Collaborators include: The Neptunes, Kanye West, The-Dream, Nottz, DJ Don Cannon and Hudson Mohawke. As his solo career progressed, Pusha\u2019s unique ability to rap over unorthodox beats allowed him to work in electronic music. See Hudson Mohawke\u2019s \u201cChimes Remix\u201d and Yogi\u2019s \u201cBurial.\u201d\n\nKing Push spoke to Genius and broke down some of his classic lines, including his famous \u201cyuugh\u201d ad-lib.\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/4863540648001/HklmClHkx_default/index.html?videoId=5237590749001\n\nhttp://players.brightcove.net/4863540648001/HklmClHkx_default/index.html?videoId=5237590742001"

Lyrics\nSorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home\nWell, the walls are talkin' to me and I know you think I'm wrong\nBut, sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!\n\nNow when the phone start to clickin', your words start to echo\nSay you got to hang up but that man won't let go\nOh, my nigga, say it ain't so\nNow we speakin' on some niggas that he say he ain't know\nWe used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops\nSo close niggas thought we had the same pops\nGraduated, gettin' money on the same blocks\nBut things changed and we ain't end up in the same box\nHearin' whispers, \"it ain't adding up\"\nGivin' you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough\nI never thought I'd be the last man standin' up\nI never thought I'd had have to question, 'Were you man enough?'\nLong letters how the streets got the best of you\nTellin' all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you\nYeah, see I can read between the lines\nSo it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5\nSorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home\nI think the Feds are lookin' through me, can't you hear it in my tone?\nSo, then sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!\nYou might also like\nGot me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls\nTryna act normal but the writin's on the walls\nIt's like I hear you smilin' when you heard they hit the wall\nBut I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall\n\"They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone\nAnd won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home\"\n\"Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome\"\nI'm just tryna offset what he was sayin' on my phone\nNowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you\nPointin' fingers like pallbearers how they carry you\nSo much for death before dishonor\nMight as well have a robe and gavel like Your Honor\nI just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers\nWhen you ride like lightnin' then you crash like thunder\nSeen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak\nWhat the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak sayin'\n\nSorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home\nWell, the walls are talkin' to me and I know you think I'm wrong\nBut, sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!\n\nLet's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga\nHow many niggas you knew snitchin' you ain't killed, nigga?\nCovered his own tracks, he didn't care that\nWe had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that\nEvery move we ever made is gettin' stared at\nI bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back\nBreak your heart when the man you call your brother\nBe the same one that set in motion all them undercovers\nCalled my mom mother, was at my graduation\nWhen I signed my record deal you was my motivation\nUh, from great friends now it's no affiliation\nDivided by the time he was facin', once he told me that\nSorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home\nSorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home\nI think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?\nSo, then sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!20Embed"

Still a target, but the badge is the new noose\nYeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain\u2019t enough proof\nSo we still lose\nYou might also like\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long\n\nI don\u2019t got no march in me, I can\u2019t turn the other cheek\nWhile they testing your patience, they just testing my reach\nFuneral flowers, every 28 hours\nBeing laid over ours\nSworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?\nLooking over their allowances\u00a0\nBuilding prisons where the mountains is\nLaptops is for the county kids\nMetal detectors is where ours is\nThey\u2019ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history\nThe fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery\nAnd so it goes, every truth don\u2019t get told\nAll these cops get cleared, and lives are stole\nEvery goose don\u2019t lay gold whoa\nJust another nigga dead, just another nigga dead\nSend another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs\nThey call in the National Guard\nPublic Enemy, I am Chuck D\nFlavor Flav in Louis V, but I\u2019m Huey P\nWoo! The new elite, it\u2019s either you or me\nLet the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me\nIt\u2019s more and more and more than Baltimore\nFrom shore to shore, oh lord\nPatience torn, patience gone, oh lord\n\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long\nI say hey, sunshine\nOh how the day can be so long27Embed"

(amen)\nI wrote it myself by the way (amen)\nYo, Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman (amen, amen)\nWe gotta give the streets what they want, man (amen)\nFuck the goddamn shit (amen)\nYou gotta get it in, bruh, let's get it (amen)\n\nYou like that, don\u2019t ya? I wrote it myself, by the way\nAnd I don\u2019t mean to be selfish, but I picture myself gettin' paid\nAnd you might catch pneumonia, 'cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh\nUh, me and Pusha back on it, now everybody help us pray\nLord forgive my sins and all my friends\nDollars make sense, I\u2019m tryin' to get paid\nYou might also like\nTryna get saved? (Too late!) time to get paid\nGot a gun and a stockin' mask, niggas thought I was tryna get waves\nI\u2019ma let all y'all niggas pray for it, my young niggas knockin' off a K for it\nSold my soul on the back end, only fuckin' way I\u2019ma pay for it\nFront that shit you put a flame on, my niggas locked in a cage for\nThey keep tellin' me to go hard, number one spot you was made for\nYuugh! I made more, front of the grill, got a racehorse\nCalifornia Crayola red, \"Glow In The Dark\" like a Ye tour\nFuck niggas steppin' in my lane for, not knowin' that it\u2019s a landmine?\nSoon as a nigga feel a cool breeze, throw the top up like a gang sign\nRed or blue, Crip or Blood, solitaires, diamond studs\nLike chandeliers, I\u2019ma flood, black Jesus piece like it\u2019s dipped in mud\nFashion gods, notice mine, rollerball spikes, I\u2019m Pok\u00e9mon\nParis shit, Louis Vuitton, under bright lights, where do you belong?\n\nPlease Lord, yeah, it\u2019s gettin' realer everyday\nNiggas killin\u2019, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can\u2019t find no yay\nSee the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay\nSo some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray\nAmen\n\nAmen, how many people do you know hatin\u2019\nOn your downfall, sittin' there, waitin\u2019?\nWhen you shine, I don't know what they gon' say then\nEverything I do now stadiums\nSo tell me what they really gon\u2019 say to him\nAnd I\u2019m headed straight to the ATM\nFinna go HAM, nigga finna go in\nNigga you'll get it when pigs fly\nWhen Yeezy fake, Devil\u2019s pie\nPiece of cake, Kit-Kat\nI need a break, God\u2019s child\nJesus Christ, club like a broken neck\nI need the ice, I need the lights, uhh\nIn Egypt they fightin\u2019 for freedom\nCop pull you over, no reason, beat 'em\nPlease Lord, yeah, it\u2019s gettin' realer everyday\nNiggas killin\u2019, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can\u2019t find no yay\nSee the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay\nSo some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray\nAmen\n\nI got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team\nEven seen 'em come 2-tone like a Saleen (Saleen?)\nSaleen, yeah that\u2019s a Mustang\nBreak \u2018em down in the night, that's what I call hustlin'\nThey say they want that dumb shit, well, this is ignorant\nCondo on the timepiece, yeah, now that's ignorant\nThey like, \"Young, you a fool\", yeah I coulda bought some real estate\nInstead I bought a half a block and tried to sew up half the streets\nI\u2019m on 75-75, when they was going for the 25\nGuess who\u2019s pickin\u2019 up a trey?

Jack-O-Lantern Push\nTrick or treat, fuck your shit, I earned it off the books\nNow listen to me vent\nWhen you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent\nShots from everywhere, but they never make a dent\nKnight in shining armor\nMistake me for the villain cause my vengeance is your karma\nYeah, fear is knowing you're a goner\nThis music to my soul, cause it's death before dishonor\nGone\nCheck! Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher\nThat used the church money to cop a new Beamer\nGot the heart of a child raised by a prostitute\nThat bought his momma the rubbers when a John came through\nIt\u2019s the microphone methadone, greatest ever etched in stone\nYou ain\u2019t getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperone\nPopping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth\nCalled the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident\nNigga I\u2019m your majesty, show up with a bag of weed\nRolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory\nMy manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams\nThe insomniac with nightmares in sixteens\nI\u2019m a wet dream, dry sense of humor\nTravel in class like a high school rumor\nNo one really cares if you embarrass us with style\nCause when it comes to them raps you been letting us down\nSo tell em why you're mad son\nGotta get it off your chest, let em know how you feel son\nYou gotta say what you say\nIt don\u2019t matter, they gonna say a nigga hating anyway15Embed"

Nigga, I\u2019ll be damned\nGator at my momma\u2019s house, welcome to zombie land\nA hustler\u2019s paradise, a lucky pair of dice\nDown 40 but a streak will have you square by night\nDidn't bat an eye I at it, kept the poker face\nCause the batter I add had the coca base\nWhen you get to heaven\u2019s door they won\u2019t hold a space\nIf you numb like the flesh on a smoker\u2019s face\nThere\u2019s no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right\nYou in Italian leather and you're four wheeling right\nYou know you\u2019re up when you count a quarter mil in white\nAnd if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight\nI\u2019m a wizard at it, nigga here\u2019s the magic\nMake a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it\nGet the green from the scale like a lizard had it\nBear witness as I unveil this instant classic\nYou might also like\nYes!

When last year I spent more money, on spilled liquor, in bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made! You\u2019re talking to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, whoa! wheelin' dealin', limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun and I'm having a hard time holding these alligators down!\u201d\n\nTo all hustlas with the same interest\nBow your heads as the Lord's mentioned\nPrayer service held in the kitchen\nI wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen\nI\u2019m what dreams are made of\nCocaine Ronald gave us\nThen Nancy tried to save us\nBy that time we had Motorola pagers\nNow we push button start motors\nYacht owners, you small ballin', that\u2019s Pop Warner\nMenage a trois in the bath house\nBlew money on \u2018em, bitches never bad mouth\nYou glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out\nYou open doors, I open jaws and pass out\nLuxury is just my lifestyle\nI\u2019m Scott free with a million dollar bright smile\n\nYou niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it\nThe bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it\nI'm what dreams are made of\nI'm what dreams are made of\nSell that pussy to me, I\u2019d rather buy it baby\nLook at ya purse you need the help, you can\u2019t deny it baby\nI'm what dreams are made of\nI'm what dreams are made of\nYou might also like\nYeah, Louboutins under sweats\nA hundred just landed from responding to a text\nNiggas talk money but I\u2019m still unimpressed\nWhen these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling underdressed\nHip Hop bores me, hustlers applaud me\nToo much school boy, not enough rude boy\nNothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy\nAnd it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy\nBentley with the rag-top yamaka\nIt says kilometers all on my speedometer\nCocaine under my tongue like thermometer\nI got the fever, I never took a breather\nNeed a way out like Nas needed an Ether\nLike Mike Vick chased by PETA\nMore pony hairs, more zebras\nMore pythons, more lizards\n\nYou niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it\nThe bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it\nI\u2019m what dreams are made of\nI\u2019m what dreams are made of\nSell that pussy to me, I\u2019d rather buy it baby\nLook at ya purse you need the help, you can\u2019t deny it baby\nI\u2019m what dreams are made of\nI\u2019m what dreams are made of5Embed"

Brendan\nOr should I say international Brendan? Marcus Paul?

I didn't have to wait in the line at bakery on Sunday mornings anymore for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was with and he'd come from around the counter. No matter how many people were waiting, I was taken care of first. Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didn't have a car. I mean at 13, I was making more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood.  I mean I had more money than I could spend. I had it all!\"\n\nI'm up in the woods\nI'm down on my mind\nI'm building a still\nTo slow down time\nI'm lost in the world\nI'm down on my line\nI'm new in the city\nAnd I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nSaid shes down for the night\nI'm lost in the world\nI'm down on my line\nI'm new in the city\nAnd I'm down for the night\nDown for the night\nSaid shes down for the night\n\nLook at my situation, I couldn\u2019t ask for more\nI\u2019m the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore\nLook what that kilo sent me, that Porsche is key less entry\nThat girl is high and drunk, I swear the rest is elementary\nWe found a superfreak, no, she won\u2019t know what hit her\nI\u2019m on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter\nYou\u2019ve got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking\nYou don\u2019t get good dick too often, I\u2019mma have you funny walking\nSee that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the fuck off and\nDamn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in\nBack to that world you lost in\nYou might also like\n(I'm up in the woods)\nRun from the lights\n(I'm down on my mind)\nRun from the night\nRun for your life\nI'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night\nI'm down for the night, down for the night\n\nI'm lost in the world, been down my whole life\nI'm new in the city, (Ooh, the city) but I'm down for the night\nDown for the night, down for the night\n(Yeah-ah-ah, yeah-ah-ah, yeah-ah-ah)\n(Yeah-ah-ah, yeah-ah-ah, yeah-ah-ah)\n(Been there for long)\n(Yeah-ah-ah, yeah-ah-ah, yeah-ah-ah)\nWho will survive in America?\nWho will survive in America? (Down for the night)\nWho will survive in America?\nWho will survive in America?\nI'm lost in the world, been down my whole life\nI'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night\nDown for the night, down for the night\nI'm lost in the world, been down my whole life\nI'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night\nDown for the night4Embed"
