Tech shit, or Columbine\nBut after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time\n(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies (Yeah)\nAnd danced around the house in all-over print panties\nMy mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me\nI'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin\n(What you think of Hayley Williams?)\nFuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them\nI'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in\nAnd stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus\nAnd won't stop until the cops come in\nI'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders\nAnd pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)\nGreen paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers\nAll I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em\nBut where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em\nIt's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em\nSnap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves\nIt's been a couple months\nAnd Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave\nDamn\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nUh, Wolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang\nUh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\nGoddamn goblin\nWolf Haley, uh, Golf Wang\nUh, Wolf Haley, Golf Wang, yeah\nThey say success is the best revenge\nSo I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in\nOh, not again, another critic writing report\nI'm stabbin' any bloggin' faggot hipster with a pitchfork\nStill suicidal, I am\nI'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand\nI'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head\nAnd I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch\n(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G\nI just wanna know if my father would ever like me\nBut I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me\nA motherfuckin' goblin\n(Fuck everything, man) That's what my conscience said\nThen it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead\nNow the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement\nActions speak louder than words, let me try this shit\nDead431Embed"

Um\nSmell my gooch, you could kiss my buns\nAnd I don't give a shit, bend my rectum\nSomebody said bands make her dance\nShe thinks you're getting cash, no, bitch, you're dumb\nThe only thing that you're gonna get is this dick\nWait, turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)\nHere, take a goddamn picture\nAnd tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nig\u200bger\nAnd while you're at it, pass the lotion\nAnd fapping and Xbox Live, that fun\nBefore I cum, I call your sister\nWhen she comes over, I take picture\nInstantly put it on Instagram\nAnd suplex her off a building if I get banned\n(I'm just fucking around)\nTamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!\nWhy y'all so salty?\nHot tamale is on\nA can of beans, bitch, I'm on\nYour boy is bad to the bone\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nBring back the horns that was played in the beginning\nAnd tell Tony Parker that I found his vision\nAnd if he's tripping off my sneak dissing (Uh)\nThen he has to deal with me and my minions\nTryna get a Bimmer, E46\nHave you heard \"48\"? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)\nGolf Wang prints always cover the sleeves\nFrom cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please\nFuck I look like? Got a new bike\nTire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke\nThink I give a fuck, I do, I go raw\nThen I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease, bitch!)\nMy urethra, hole that I pee from\nBigger than the obese neck on Aretha\nNow turn that snare down, I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare\nOn the same damn bus like, \"You're going to jail now\"\nTamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!\nWhy y'all so salty?\nHot tamale is on\nA can of beans, bitch, I'm on\nYour boy is bad to the bone\n\nHow much wood could a woodchuck chuck\nIf a woodchuck could ever give a fuck? Bitch, suck dick\nMotherfuck' you and your opinions\n(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can, sir, where the lump is\nSicker than the last bar bold-er, I'm a CO\nColorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I'm badder than my BO\nFind me and Lance tryna dance during chemo\nBefore they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos\nYeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!\nGolf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!\nWhy y'all so salty?\nHot tamale is on\nA can of beans, bitch, I'm on\nYour boy is bad to the bone\n\nHow many fags can a lightbulb screw?\nWell, if it has a dick, maybe two or six\nAnd tell the NRA I'm 'bout to lose my shit\nAnd shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix\nHow many ladies in the house?\nHow many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?\nA little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'\nHope my mom don't catch me\nTryna set mood, little RedTube, fuck lotion\nI don't need lube, dry fist suits me (Yeah)\nUp and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound\nThe shit's kind of disgusting, fap time\nAnd before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me\nThis shit's so damn embarrassing, like\u2014\n\nOh, shit, aw, fuck\nWhat the fuck?\nAw, I'm sorry\nIs that my shirt?\nYeah, I'm sorry, I just wanted some bangs\nClean that shit up, we're going to the office!\nFuck181Embed"

Posers looking silly, boy\nI'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi\nNot a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese\nNa'kel Smith, Transworld page 64\nPoppin' like oil ollie in fire flames\nI'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game\nThe fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name\nAbout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes\nBut he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists\nGod damn menace, 666 and he's not finished\nAnd my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?\nSee y'all niggas tripping, man\nLook at that article that says my subject matter is wrong\nSaying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs\nLook at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me\nThough I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat\nLook at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind\nBut talk is money, I said, \"Hi,\" I guess I bought him some time\nLook at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?\nThey thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?\nBut then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan\nAnd it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements\nAnd MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing\nBruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings\n\"Analog\" fans are getting sick of the rape\nAll the \"Tron Cat\" fans are getting sick of the lakes\nBut what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints\nBut I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank\nOh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?\nMy fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct\nFuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink\nRecord the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch\nNigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\nSummer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\nThis shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering\nSo much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me\nBut Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)\nAll I\u2019m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me\nThat the 40's half off, like you know that cliff\nDon't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)\nOr get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids\nSo maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)\nMalt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and\nAll of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)\nDirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs\nBrother the Pigeons is us\nBid you goodnight and good luck\n(Oh, shut the fuck up!)\n(Gunshot)\nSamuel's here!

This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat\nMy father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet\nI cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed\nSomebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed\nThis meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son\n\nMy mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent\nThat I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers\nAre much important, I'm getting angrier while recording\nI'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves\nOdd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental\nSimple, but probably not, fuck em\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nI'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck\nDrunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked\nSuspended from school, coolest nigga without effort\nEasy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard\nSoak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on\n'Cause this album pack enough evil\nThat you can't fit inside a Jansport\nGo to school with this\n\nI go from AP to JC inside a fucking week\nWaking up with random girls like \"Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?\"\nI stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet\nEvery time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit\nNo to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes\nBy those that were slow as molasses\nTake this shit to school\n\nRaquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger\nShe still don't know I made \"Sarah\" to strangle her\nNot put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler\nAll because she said no to homecoming, demons running\nInside my heads telling me evil thoughts\nI'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep\nI wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky\n\"Fuck me,\" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead\nInside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil\nWith this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble\nI'm on my grind feeble, my music is either\nA fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church\n\nI graduated without honors or fucking father\nHe died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother\nI wanted a brother, my mother I told her\nBut instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada\nSo both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation\nThat's having our brains racing like Dayton\nWearing some fucking Heelys\n\nI know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me\nBut times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly\nI'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11\nSeven, what's religion nigga? I am legend\nI roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition\nI created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented\nThan 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci\nWhen they have kids they haven't seen in years\nImpressing their peers\nWith the same problem, the only way to solve them\nIs to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver\nLife's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it\nShit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious\nCause my mother let me do what I want\nShe wasn't careless, protective she is the bear\nThe shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid\nMy father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit\nMy mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents\nWhen Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share\nThis confused boy, I wanna hug, oy\nI\u2019m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice\nI'm bad milk, drink it\nWhoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say\nUh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating\n\nMy wrist is all red from the cutter\nDripping cold blood like the winter, the summer\nIs never that's equivalent to me and Sarah\nWell that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever\nMy niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing\nBut I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing\nWith a tear they try to tell me but I never listen\n'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing\nEighteen, still talking to imaginaries\nHopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy\nLosers can never win me, you can never offend me\nMy goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the\nCeremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal\nThis my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this\nFuck a deal, I just want my father's email\nSo I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail\n\nWow, umm\nSo, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something\nWhat would you tell him?105Embed"

(I don't know)\nNow me and she held hands and we danced, nothin' more\nShe kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored\nThere's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid\nFuck, because\n\n'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fuckin' young (For me, uh)\nAnd when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (No)\nAnd, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fuckin' young\nAnd this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)\n\nA six-year difference, uh\nIs a ten year sentence\nAnd with the pigment on my skin\nI don't want to be another statistic\nYou bring me joy, joy, joy, joy\nAnd you fill a void that was once missing\nAnd I can say I'm in love\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nThere go the policeman, knocking at my door\nDo I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?\nOr do I answer real confused like, \"I don't know\"?

What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on\n\nI'm not a fucking role model (I know this)\nI'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams\nSince Kanye tweeted tellin' people he's bumpin' all of my shit\nThese motherfuckers think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit\nI'm still jackin' off and proceedin' my life careless\nBut getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris (as you should)\nPhilly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares\nAt skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird\nYonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked\nNow competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked\nHe still hasn't called me yet (that's not your fault)\nBut that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it\nAnd a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy\nA couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking\nThem nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat\nBastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?\n\n\"Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual\"\n\"Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied\"\n\"You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine\"\n\"I try too hard, huh?\"\n\"No, you don't\"\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nMade a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet\nThe 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set\nNigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity\nI'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity\nOh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper\nCause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?\nI'm the star of the group (Yeah)\nSo no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you\n(Bastard was good though) What you think I record it for?\nTo have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?\nLike I didn't make \"Parade\" or \"Inglorious\"\nCause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?\nOf course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off\nIn the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off (I bet)\nMessage boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver (here)\nLet me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor\n\n\"Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?\"\n\"I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that.\"\n\"I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now.\"\n\"Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at  home?\"\n\"What the fuck you mean I'm not talented?

Start to gobble his mic?\nAnd start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? (No...

It hit my eyelid\nLove is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'\nWhat we doing? How y'all doing?\nOh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck\nI ain't been sleepin' well\nTwin, I'll never tell\nStay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in\nI stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)\nI thought you wanted to dance, I\n\nMaybe, maybe (For you)\nWhat's the chance, though?\nI wish that we had better timing\nI'll save a dance just for you\nSo don't forget about me, ba-ba-ba-da\nI'll save a dance just for you\nI wish that we had better timing\nI'll save a dance just for you (Only for you, only for you)\nSo don't forget about me (No), ba-ba-ba-da\nI'll save a dance just for you78Embed"

It's Wolf Gang, \"Yonkers\", Goblin is my shit though\"\nNow I'm like, \"fuck, I don't want to be an asshole\"\nSo I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Davon\nWith a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on\nSo fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath\n'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot (Tyler's here!)\nNow I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo\nAll because they noticed the top with the box logo\nAnd them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard\nThey bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo\nI'm going fucking loco, \"Hey, Tyler, can I...?\"\nNo, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?\n\"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied\nUntil I heard \"Radicals,\" the last part got to me\nSee, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed\nNow I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be\nMy life is just like yours, no father\nMy momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom\nIn school, I was the one that was thinking outside boxes\nSo everybody in them would say that I got problems\nSo when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em\nYou're an inspiration to niggas like me\nNot the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats\nI'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be\nI heard the song \"Bastard\" right in the moment of heat\nNot in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat\nGun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord\nAnd it drew me in like predators carrying treats\nThen I said to myself, \"Fuck, is he speaking to me?\"\nSee, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat\nI mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?\nI carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard\nOn my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard (That's weird)\nThat's hard, that scar from playing air guitar\nWhen I see you play at the Roxy (Uhh)\nTyler, I love you, wanna be just like you (Alright)\nI think about your face and I don't even fucking try to (No homo)\nWish I had a basement meant for me to hide you\nWe could play Xbox and listen to \"In Search Of...\" and eat donuts\nOver conversating 'bout what church does\nCome up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs\nI'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip\nAnd Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch\nYou should've took me instead (Uhh, that's weird)\nSee, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither\nAnd if I can't have you then she shouldn't either\nNo one should see you, but me in your t-shirt\nI worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt (What the fuck)\nOdd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing\nI know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob\nBut I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin (yeah, you are)\nI ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times\n'Cause (Thanks for the support) I love you, man (Alright)\nI like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees\nI like pants that's cut, I like words like \"fuck\"\nI got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out\nNow paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw (What the fuck)\nAnd I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day\nAnd now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a \"hey\" (Sorry)\nAnd my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play \"VCR\"\nIn my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors...\"\nAll right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic\nSo I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses\n(Tyler, listen) No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit\nAnd I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick\nBut I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar\nAfter spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers\n\"Yonkers\" and \"Yonkers\" (I love that song) Sick of hearing about \"Yonkers\"\nI'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered\n\"Yeah, whatever, but I had a fucking blast at that concert\nI was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan\nThe one that say \"Sagan Lockhart\" and when you came out to \"Sandwitches\"\nThat's when my fucking boy-crush got started\"\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nJust take this fucking picture man, shit...85Embed"

I gotta keep it buck-fifty\nWhat if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera\nAt them shitty apartments that's across from Bank of America?\nDamn, I would be hurtin'\nWriting all of these songs 'cause Wi-Fi wasn't working (Nah)\nLast year, in total, I put out two verses\nBut five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect\nOh, is it really? Oh, is it really?

think anybody noticed\nYou asked me if I was comin' to city you from\nMaybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb\nIf I denied long legs, good ears, great taste\nSmell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face\nAnd we clicked, we was at each other's hips\nI ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough\nYou and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly\nWe was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy\nI wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings\nYou told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with\nDamn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected\nBut I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it\nWe still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it\nThe problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him\nIt's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross\nBut you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost\nI try to keep it together, never felt this way\nWe spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day\nAnd they say, \"Bros over hoes,\" I'm like, \"Mm, nah, hey\"\nI would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake\nBut whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance\nI'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nIt's, it's like starting a race\nAnd then when you take off, they like, \"No, no, it's not a end,\" ha\nIt was too late and shit\n\nFaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage\nIt's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions\nYou hit me with the look and replied like, \"Duh, bitch\"\nDon't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back\nCross the line, cross the line, cross the\u2014 nah, we never did that\nThough I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back\nAnyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it\nRight in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious\nYou sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies\nWe walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid\nHe see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, \"Ha-ha-ha\"\nWhenever we \"Ha-ha-ha,\" we subtly press his buttons\nNot on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose\nIf I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it\nBut, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it\nAnd plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real\nSurface\n\nI said surface, like, 'cause they got roots\nLike, I'm the new nigga\nBut you know, they be fuckin', haha\nYeah, yeah\nDidn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me\nKnow y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me\nI feel guilty, but not as much as I should\nI tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could\nI been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face\nI can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place\nI never been jealous of another man\nEspecially when I have everything I want at hand\nExcept you, you\n\nYou know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs\nBut it's like, \"No, I want that,\" ha\n\nHe left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head\nYou dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, \"No, you pick a place\"\nWe could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here\nAs long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh\nYou was supposed to go back home to see your bestie\nI told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week\nYou was like, \"Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that\"\nSeven days with me, your nigga like, \"Where the fuck you at?\"\nDirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot\nChauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants\nParks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names\nManicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane\nShoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?\nSee, the price is not a option\nIt's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me\nI know around him, you gotta act like you not into me\nI know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me\nSaid you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him\nThen why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?\nThey all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more\nEverything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours\nThe only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it\nAnd everyone around me that care about me can see it\nI could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in\nMen or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em\nBut with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'\nYou stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress\nWhole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back\nIn the back of the car with you and talk about who we are\nYou told me when you with me, it's like heroin\nTold me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and\nTold me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?\nTold me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it\nTold me every time you not with him, it started problems, and\nTold me every time you not with me, you always ponder\nWhat type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding\nGirl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over\nYou said you told him the truth and you never lied\nNow he lookin' at you with them eyes\nWe never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off\nHe picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off\nMy energy like, \"Get lost,\" your energy just want peace\nI couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak\nHe ain't even call you his bitch\nUntil he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit\nI'm in the wrong, though\nI picked you up, your energy off\nYour lips really dry, something is off\nYou ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta\nWe trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata\nWe sat in the car and cried for a hour\nMy shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off\nI'll skip the details but that night I seen hell\nYou was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls\nNo, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell\nThey buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill\nNext day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up\nWater in my eyes kept falling like Niagara\nVill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or\nDo something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up\nYou checked every box, I thought it was it\nFelt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff\nNo, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend\nNo, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it\nYou in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped\nGotta rewind it\u2014 aw, fuck\nWe talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links\nYou don't do that type of shit when you in relationship\nAnd you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint\n'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on\nAnd while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home\nShit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along\nBut shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun\nYou still got your nigga and still had your fun\nShit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words\nThat's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms\nWe straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends\nAnd laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh\nThis my perspective, this how I feel\nI ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real\nI told you I love you and always will\nAnd if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true\nTrue, true, true, yeah\nOn God, I love that girl, f\u2014 mhm\nI'm a sh\u2014 I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person\nI had no ill intentions, though\nShit, everybody got hurt\nI got hurt, bruh\nIt's a shit situation\nAll the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing\nAnd those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control\nThat made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either\nWe're all just children\nI ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man\nI thought I was bulletproof\nShe proved me wrong, man\nI felt two hundred percent with her\nIt was beautiful\nI was able to feel\nBut it was, it was bad timing\nAnd I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and\nI just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows\nSafe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts\n'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it\nBut I guess you're just another chapter in the book33Embed"

This ain't my lifestyle\nNever had no scare in my life 'til now\nAin't in the space to raise no goddamn child\nHey, Jane, I'm terrified, petrified\nI don't wanna give my freedom up, or sanitize it\nThis my fault, the results are justified\nI fucked up, I'm stressed out, I'm dead inside\nBut, hey, Jane, who am I to come bitch and complain?\nYou gotta deal with all the mental and the physical change\nAll the heaviest emotions, and the physical pain\nJust to give the kid the man last name? Fuck that (That's dumb as fuck)\nOur r\u00e9sum\u00e9s unmet, the bus stopped at like\nWe ain't make it to love yet\nTook a shortcut to forever, I'm upset (Fuck)\n'Cause we was in the back, no strings, with our tongues wet\nWe haven't boat tripped, we haven't argued\nWe still learnin' each other, I don't know all of you\nAnd you don't know all of me, how am I to live with?\nThat is not a good foundation to have kids with\nOr maybe it is, maybe it's not, just not yet\nMaybe this a blessing in disguise, not a regret\nLook, Jane, it's your choice at the end of the day\nJust know I'll support either way, no pressure\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nHey, T, we got the news and I forgot how to breathe\nIn a panic, you was comfortin' me\nDamn, what do we do? What are the odds? Is this really true?\nIf it was bound to happen to me, I'm lucky it's you\nHey, T, your legs long and your waist thin\nAnd we can both relate to the fact we got great skin\nYou're not dumb, and your energy is a good mood\nA lil' weird, but overall, you's a good dude, huh\nHey, T, how would you feel if we kept it a secret?\nIt's a voice inside me begging to keep it\nI'm thirty-five and my ovaries might not reset\nI don't wanna live my whole life feelin' regret\nDamn, a feeling you could never understand (I can't)\nYou just hope to God I get my period again\nI was twenty-four when\u2014\nLook, I don't wanna go through that experience again\nHey, T, things happen, no one is wrong (It was an accident)\nBut I don't need the stress, I can do this alone\nMy mom did it, your mom did it, this ain't a pride thing\nThis a more \"I'd prefer to have peace of mind\" thing\nI got my own bread, I don't need you to buy things\n'Cause my needs don't include your money or status\nI can move back to London and avoid any static\nBetween us, no need to make it hard like a callus\nThere's too much on your palate, this is really traumatic for me\nI can raise it by myself, I'm dramatic, you see?\nPushing people out my life is a habit I seethe\nCan you crack a window so I can breathe? (Yeah)\nHey, T, I'm scared too (I am too)\nIt was so hard for me to tell you, to tell truth\nI ain't wanna tell me, I look in the mirror, like, damn, I failed me\nI'm scared to tell my mama, scared to tell my bitches\nScared of all the people who don't know us in our business\nScared of all they advice and my intuition\nScared of not knowin', but too scared to make decisions\nI said I wouldn't do this again\nIt's a lose if I lose lil' bruh in the end\nAnd it's a lose-lose, if I lose you as a friend\nI been losin' myself, it ain't no one to defend me\nI got a mini version of myself livin' in me\nYou pullin' out your hair, I walk around in a frenzy\nI'm feelin' the resentment any time you get near me\nMy body has a clock and I don't know where the end be\nEmotions is throwin' around like a frisbee\nMy titties gettin' bigger and I'm cravin' a ten-piece\nT, no matter the decision today, I just want us to be cool either way\nNo pressure5Embed"

I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some\nMy father called me to tell me he loved me\u2014\nI'd have a better chance of gettin' Taylor Swift to fuck me\nAnnoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me\nI'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me\nFeel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all\nI'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant\nIgnorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it\nBecause I am the devil, fucker, get on my level\nDoughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers\nMy life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a lil' darker\nI'll see you in a couple, O.F\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare (Nightmare)\nThis is Hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair (Fight fair)\nMy spirit floats around in the night air (Night air)\nOr in your day dreams, that's how death seems (Death)\nI told her I'm her worst nightmare (Nightmare)\nThis is Hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair (Fight fair)\nMy spirit floats around in the night air (Night air)\nOr in your daydreams, that's how death seems (Death)\n\nTyler, here's some water, man.

Don't worry, you'll probably never see them again (Again!)\nGrab a couple friends, start a couple riots\nCrash a couple (Planes, planes, planes)\nThen, gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers\nOdd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus\nIt's us, nigga\nI said it's us, nigga\n\nBum, bum, bum, bum, bum\nBum, bum, bum, bum, bum\nCan we get this over?\nBum, bum, bum, burum-rum-rum-rum, bum, bum, bum\nBum, bum, bum-bum-bum-bum, hehe\nThank you\nWe are the Sams, and we're dead\u2014it's just four of us\nWe come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious\nWe took their heads, but we just took back what they took from us\nI guess we lost ours...\n\nMusic had nothing to do with my final decision\nI just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention\nBut nobody would listen but stuffed animals that I had\nSince I was a kid, but I'm growing up, so they're missing\nI didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry\nI wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army\nI'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me\nMama, I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?\nI don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home\nAnd I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone\nAnd I... I hear helicopters, make 'em dip\nI'm fucking reloaded, I told you all that I ain't taking shit\nYou better back up before this Mac start to lift up\nI'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up\nThe difference between us and our class is tan khakis\nI got ninety-nine problems and all of them's being happy37Embed"

(Ain't you heard, nigga?)\nThis perspective from the beak of a bird\nYou hope I peak, you take my peace\nYou gon' see me and run like thieves in the night\nI'm paranoid, I sleep with a gun\nThe heat on my dungaroos because they beefin' for fun\nI'm vegan for now, I'm conscious, know my hands meet when I bow\nI'm grateful, you niggas hateful, you eat at me, you got a plate full\nYou can't relate to these things I say to these instrumentals\nWhether it's wealth talk or shit that's painful\nI paint full pictures of my perspective on these drum breaks\nJust for you to tell me it's not good from your lunch break\nHoliday season\nA vision you have to understand from perspective\nCheck your resources, nigga29Embed"

Better check my French (My French)\nUh, what time is it, huh? check my French (My French)\nIf you got my shit, you better check my French (Motherfucker!)\nI'm making moves, sh\u2014 check my French (My French)\nI speak English, but check my French (My French)\nYour ho be on my penis, she check my French\nBitch!\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nI guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard\n'Cause every girl I'm digging\nWhen I'm digging in her pussy, I'm never using (A rubber)\nBut fuck it, I guess I gotta stretch it out like it was flubber\nAnd leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers\nChewing on cum like bubblegum from Hubba\nThis bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp (Hahahaha)\nYeah\nYo, I'm seventeen, already sniffing blow\nI tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat\nI got a new show for MTV: \"Pimp My Boat\"\nBecause some bitch said my semen was dirty, that silly ho\nThe most that they can do is fine me\nI'm hiding, somewhere where Chris Stokes can't find me\n\"Oh no, Mr. Stokes, I don't like misters, no\"\nDon't tell R. Kelly where my little sister go\n\nYou little niggas better check my French (My French)\nUgh, you getting money?

I don't think so\nWe sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo\nThese Odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink flows\nWe think sorta odd, so we think so\n\nCrusing in my go-kart at Walmart selling cupcakes\nGo 'head, admit it, faggot, this shit is tighter than butt rape\nThat involve Ballpark Franks and silver duct tape\nPornos, some hormones, and boxes of DiGiorno\nYou homos is loco, you probably drinking Cuervo\nWith some vatos, with the door closed, watching \"Zorro\"\nYou homos\nO.F.\nYes\nSo, are you dating anyone right now? You know, or...\nNo, I'm\u2014 I'm just playing the field, you know?\nAh, so... I'm guessing she's white, since she's \"vanilla\"\nHaha28Embed"

Let's\u2014, anything else you've gotta say?\n\nMom is getting jealous, I see my manager more than I see her\nBefore I go on tour, and it hurts (Yeah)\nI miss the days when this was fun, but now, it turned into work\nAnd getting legal, so I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out (As you should, that shit's outrageous)\nMy friends are turning into opposites\nBecause my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist\nAnd all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick\nHarder than the white kids who copy shit\nEnding it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about\nAll alone, bawling 'til my mo'fuckin' eyes bleed\nSee, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets dis-gur-sting\nWhen there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck (I'm here to talk to you)\nI'm putting myself at a distance\nFor instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant (Who, Travis?)\nNiggas saying \"Free Earl\" without even knowin' him\nSee, they're missing a new album; I'm missing my only friend\n\nYou have everyone around you\nYou have thirty meetings a day\nI don't see what it is\nI mean, you\u2014 you act like you don't have anyone to talk to\nI'm here for you. I'm your friend\nWhen I say, \"Odd,\" y'all say \"Future\"\nOdd...

Oh, this Bathing Ape cape?\nBitch, I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood Target\nFangs are sharp, and I hope you know\nThat all I really want from you is that throat\nI can't eat pussy 'cause I might leave cuts\nThen there's blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus\nOn the channel, a fucking animal, leaking like pairs of candles\nBitch, is it hard to handle?\nI don't want a bride, I just want bone marrow (Oh, shit!)\n(It's because) Umm, I'm Dracula, bitch!\nDon't got a problem smackin' a bitch\nKidnappin', attacking, with axes and shit\n'Til I grab them throats and start smackin' them shits\n(It's because) I'm Dracula, bitch!\nDon't got a problem smackin' a bitch\nKidnappin', attacking, with axes and shits\n'Til she decides to take Dracula's dick\n\nBite her in her fucking neck, bite her in her fucking neck\nBottom of the fucking lake, bottom of the fucking lake\nCall my gang of wolves and bats, call my gang of wolves and bats\nIt\u2019s a full moon tonight, and these hoes ain't actin' right\n(It's because) 'Cause I'm Dracula, bitch!

(Ha, I'm in my own school)\nAnd you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs\nI hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended\nIn Search Of... did more for me than Illmatic\nThat's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric\nI made my own shit, you went out and bought yours\nMan, I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic\nLa-di-da-di, I'm going harder\nThan coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers\nWhen it's a lot at stake carne asada but let's be honest, I'm really morphing\nNamed my album \"Cherry Bomb\" because \"Greatest Hits\" sounded boring\nI don't like to follow the rules\nShe said that I must, I don't have any armpits\nShe wanted to talk; \"Who's in charge of this Golf shit?\"\nI said \"Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant\nAnd who I are isn't really important\nMy heart is as dark as a window with car tint\nSo hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it\nAnd I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick.\"\nIt's young T\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\nI don't like to follow the rules\nAnd that's just who I am\nI hope you understand\nAnd I don't really think y'all cool\nSo give yourself a hand\nNo, no, give yourself a hand\nBetter pose for that camera\nYou better pose, boy, you better pose\nAnd it's your life, nigga, I suppose\nFor the lights, for the camera, and the action\nNow your face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights\nNigga, you ask for this life\n\nWelcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nKissing on my bean bag\nYour lips high-five my tongue\nAnd my fingers moonwalk through your hair\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)\nThis is fun, I can tell\nI don't know if you'll handle it well\nWelcome to hell camp\n(Lights, and the camera, and the action)\nYou should be mine in a way tonight\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)130Embed"

It's the slave in me\nIt's facts, boy, I'm back like Rosa Parks's least favorite seat\nVideos, stage dives, popups, they watching T\nWhile y'all niggas watching the throne, the throne be watching me\nSee Tyler, The Creator LiveGet tickets as low as $20You might also like\n\"If you fuck this up...
