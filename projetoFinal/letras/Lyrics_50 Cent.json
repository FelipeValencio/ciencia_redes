  "plain": "Curtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is an American rapper, entrepreneur, investor, record producer, and actor.\n\nAfter recording a never-released album with Columbia, 50 got on his grind and rose to fame via a string of well-received mixtapes, thus setting the template for rap stardom in the modern era.\n\n50\u2019s crowning success came in 2003 with the release of the album Get Rich or Die Tryin' which sold 872,000 copies in four days and was certified 8x platinum by the RIAA. Since that monster hit, he has continued to make music while also delving into movies, sports drinks, video games, mass charity campaigns, and more.\n\nThe moniker 50 Cent might seem like an unusual, downright humble name for a rapper, but it has nothing to do with the cash in Jackson\u2019s pocket. He adopted the name after his criminal past as a drug dealer and a subsequent conviction. Trying to better himself, he saw \u201c50 Cent\u201d as a metaphor for change."

(Homie)\n\nMany men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nEvery night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back\nI know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat\nIn my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me\nPsychic says some bitch done put a hex on me\nThe feds didn't know much when Pac got shot\nI got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked\nI ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time\nAre you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?\nIn the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around\nHommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down\nNow it's clear that I'm here for a real reason\n'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'\n\nMany men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me136Embed"

(Yeah!)\nHe'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the\nMotherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity\nNow take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each\nOne of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fuckin' see\nThat'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me\nI done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin'\nUp! You\u2019re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me\nFeels like I'ma snap any minute\nYeah, it's happenin' again\nAnd I'm thinkin' about just sayin', \"Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!\"\n\u2018Cause this is all I know\nThis is why so hard I go\nI swear to God I put my heart and soul\nIn this more than anybody knows\nI'm trapped, so all I do is rap\nBut every time I rap I'm more trapped\nAnd I rap myself right to this bubble\nOh I guess it's bubble wrap (Haha)\nIt's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis\nChrist, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?\nFeels like I'm goin' psycho again (Ch, ch, ch, ch)\nAnd I might just blow my lid\nShit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid\n\u2018Cause I'm runnin' in circles with\u2014\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try, yeah\n\nI haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid\nSold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did\nMaybe this is for me, maybe\nMaybe I'm supposed to go crazy\nMaybe I'll do it 3 a.m. in the morning like Shady\nPsycho killer, Michael Myers\nI'm on fire like a lighter\nTry to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick\nWrap your head up in plastic\nPussy, now pick the casket\nDirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic\nIt's sad, it's never gonna end\nNow we number one again\nWith that frown on your face and your heart full of hate\nAccept it, respect it, this a gift God-given\nLike the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'\nMy life, my life\nMakes me wanna run away\nThere's no place to go\nNo place to go\nAll the confusion\nIt's an illusion, like a movie\nGot nowhere to go\nNowhere to run and hide\nNo matter how hard I try, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)52Embed"

Top of the world!\nI'm going crazy\nI'm going out of my head\n\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head\n\nI'm exhausted, last night I lost it\nLet the homies get loose, I'm sure I'ma get the lawsuit\nNana called, my granddaddy coughing up blood\nGot an infection, the cycle of life just sucks\nI bet when he die, she die, just because\nThey been together 60 years, that's what they call love\nPaid for my first cousin wedding, over 200 grand\nThen two kids and six years later, he's the wrong man\nI woke up this morning, really wasn't feeling myself\nThought about suicide but me, I ain't killing myself\nMy cousin Dory shot his girlfriend then shot himself in the head\nBefore I shoot myself, I'm shooting everyone else kid\nMy head aching, my hands shaking, I'm sweating bullets\nAnd it ain't even hot in this bitch, I'm going through it\nMy mind playing tricks on me, I mean, shit homie\nI might need a straitjacket fit for me\nSee 50 Cent LiveGet tickets as low as $144You might also like\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head\n\nMy favorite uncle Roc got twisted 'til that liquor gave him sugar\nHad complications once or twice, that shit fucked up his liver\nTo me he\u2019s still the man cause see me I still remember\nThat lil\u2019 snorkel he bought me to stay warm that December\nI was sleeping in the basement, the window had a draft\nEven with the electric heater, I was freezing my ass\nI got some money now so if I die before him, I'ma leave it to him\nHe can have a fine nurse put that insulin needle to him\nCalled my son twice, he ain't picking up the phone\nAnd Banks, me and him don't even talk no more\nYou know cause of me, he ain't never have to sell crack\nNever used no knife or had to squeeze no strap\nBut if I go tonight, I bet you I'm hellbound\nFor cocaine distribution and letting off MAC rounds\nHome invasion robberies, we ran in that crack house\nTook them niggas paper and all of they packs out\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head\n\nThen I was in the second row the second time Em married Kim\nLooking at Proof like, \"How much you think this gon' cost them?\"\nFeels like a set up, Shaniqua's being nice to me\nI rather a nigga just put a knife in me\nThan go through the emotions, the confusion and commotions\nNever die down in my head, they keep going\nIt feels like I'm God's punching bag on occasions\nAmazing, on other days, I feel like I'm His favorite\nI never bite my tongue, I just call a spade a spade\nWhen life feeding me lemons, I just make lemonade\nMy nana beat cancer, it came back for a rematch\nLife without my old girl, I couldn't see that\nMy grandpa was the strongest, then he broke down and I broke down\nI looked around like if shit go bad now, who I'm gon' go to now?\nThat was his partner, see he knew everything about her\nNow he's saying he don't wanna live without her\nIt feels like I'm going crazy\nNothing can save me\nI'm goin' close to the edge, hey, hey\nI can't stop staring out my window\nChoppa and my pistol\nI'm goin' out of my head, he-he-head9Embed"

I don't know\n\nIt's the money that makes shit get ugly\nIt's the money that makes these hoes love me\nIt's the money that makes niggas wanna slug me\nMan, I thought the money would make it all lovely\nYo, I actually write what I do and see\nThe felonies from day to day make me say what I say\nWhen I die my art will be worth as much as Picasso's\nDon't cry for me, smile for me\nAnd if you see them niggas who wet me wile' for me\nRemember the good times, the chips we stacked, the clips we packed\nAnd all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack\nLet my tombstone read \"I Tried\" and from the start\nEverything I wrote was from my heart\nSo it\u2019s always gon' be number one on my chart\nI get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art\nSometimes it sounds like I'm playin' but I'm sayin'\nThis shit is real\nIt ain't a game\nSee 50 Cent LiveGet tickets as low as $144You might also like\nThey say the good die young\nI guess these grimy niggas live a long time\nSit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine\nKeep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine\nThey say the good die young\nI guess these grimy niggas live a long time\nSit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine\nKeep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine\n\nFirst it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big\nI'm convinced it can happen to anybody, kid\nSo I get vest up when I get dressed up\nIn the hood it's messed up, niggas running 'round shooting shit up\nIf it's Dom that you drinking fill up my cup\nIf you gossiping about me shut the fuck up\nWhy do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?\nWhen getting robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck\nDuke listen, if you move I'mma hurt you\nYou'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue\nRight now what you need to do is give me the cash\nForget about your boss being mad, just save ya ass\nBe a good boy now, go and get your stash\nI seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash\nAlright, run along before I shoot ya ass\nI hate to do this to you, but I really need this cash\nThey say the good die young\nI guess these grimy niggas live a long time\nSit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine\nKeep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine\nThey say the good die young\nI guess these grimy niggas live a long time\nSit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine\nKeep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine\n\nI know we all gonna go, but I'd hate to go fast\nThen again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last\nMan listen, if you really really like this shit\nNigga, call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit\nCall him now before I drop for real cause after I drop\nI'mma be chargin' ya'll niggas like forty a pop\nTo each his own: me? I'd get it while it was cheap\nTypical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street\n1999's the year of the predator, I'm killing to eat\nNiggas'll treat you like a egg, when you come to cop you get beat\nGive me your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? What a treat\nYou're a generous guy, take 'em off or die\nMan, we hurting 'round here, ain't nobody slinging pies\nLook around, ain't nobody 'round here fly\nWhy you 'round here with this shit anyway? Huh?

But the other night I'm in the gambling spot. Nigga come up in here - boom - hit the door. \"Get the fuck on the floor, bitch, get down on the floor.\" I turn around like, \"what?\" Niggas like, \"get down!\" (When was this?) I'm like, \"nigga, I got on white linen.\"\n\nFuck it, I mean we gotta kill what we eat, right? It's not a problem, it's really not a problem. Southside\n\nOkay, the dope addin' up, the coke addin' up\nThe smoke addin' up, my pockets are fattened up\nI got bitches in my bedroom, nerds on computers\nDiamonds 'round my neck, straps for my shooters\nI made it, look ma', I made it\nI grind so hard to get here I can't be faded\nI got lawyers on the line, five different kinds\nFive different crimes, same .45\nGot client-attorney privilege, so a nigga ain't lyin'\nCause they ain't gon' say I did it and I ain't gon' say I did it\nAnd I might go back and forth to court, but I bet I get acquitted\nCan you dig it? Nigga, can you dig it?\nShit changed, a nigga ain't broke\nI had a safe size as a shoe box, it felt like a vault\nNow I got real money, that \"fuck how you feel\" money\nThat \"nigga, you look at me wrong, get killed\" money\nSee 50 Cent LiveGet tickets as low as $144You might also like\nYou gon' be part of my body bag ritual\nHop out, hammer out to get at you\nYou gon' be part of my body bag ritual\n.45 lettin' off some shit at you\nYou gon' be put in a body bag\nYou won't get a chance to fire back\n\nI peep my swag in the mirror, I think I got a crush on me\nI don't want no wack bitches touchin' me\nTailor-made threads, satin sheets on my bed\nGet a bitch sea-sick, waves all on my head\nDiamonds in my ear, Baccarat chandelier\nGabbana underwear, I'm so fly it ain't fair\nEvery day a different dime piece\nRose Gold, a different time piece\nHublot, AP or rollie\nYour bitch and your jeweler know me, homie\nI'm bulletproof, go 'head, take a shot at me\nYou be a dead nigga like the last one that got at me\nMy shirt level three so I ain't got a vest on\nMy heart like ice, my chest like teflon\nI'm a nightmare right here, just me and my knife, nigga\nDon't let me find out you ain't 'bout that life, nigga\nIt's doomsday, I mean goon day\nI get the orders, like, \"air out the room, Dre\"\n\nYou gon' be part of my body bag ritual\nHop out, hammer out to get at you\nYou gon' be part of my body bag ritual\n.45 lettin' off some shit at you\nYou gon' be put in a body bag\nYou won't get a chance to fire back\n\nThe mollies had a shorty ass trippin' strippin' in my kitchen\nPush my thumb in her ass while I was strokin' her kitten\nI be in my own zone, still clutchin' the chrome\nTalk state of the art, you will see 'nine to foe\nMy passport need pages, I'm fuckin' round' out in London\nJetlag from jets, wrist lit baguettes\nTrippin' in my charm, look bitch, I'm a don\nSo shit go how I say it go, fuck if I'm right or wrong\nMy paper long, bomb kush in the bong\nIt feels like I'm dreamin' cause a nigga on\nI'm so far from a hammy down, I'm out in Miami now\nMy bitch no  speak no ingles, she fresh off the boat\nShe give me neck, what you expect? I got connects for the dope\nI'm no joke, blow 30k on the coke, stuff ten in the coat\nNigga, front, I'll have a hand full of dreadlocks\nBitch, I hit your ass with a headshot\nYou gon' be part of my body bag ritual\nHop out, hammer out to get at you\nYou gon' be part of my body bag ritual\n.45 lettin' off some shit at you\nYou gon' be put in a body bag\nYou won't get a chance to fire back19Embed"

I'm blowing a ten\nBecause Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison\nI'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps\nI'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack\nNow every morning's a fast start\nBut it ain't a problem getting dressed\n'Cause my closet got more aisles than Pathmark\nRun when we starting a raid\nOr leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs\nI'm a young pimp, pardon my age\nI don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids\nNiggas find out what club they at, take them with us\nAnd run a trains on 'em, like a subway map\nYour advance is a grey Acura; see these record labels\nGot most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper\nI go to college on the tour\nI'm going down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur\nKeep your ammo clean, TECs polished in the drawer\nCamera's by the hampers that monitor the floor\nBy now, you probably heard of me, fresh out of surgery\nFlashy as a fuck, you gon' have to murder me\nBurglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy\nWhite tee burgundy, you match now, back down\nNiggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear\nCatch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear\nHeavy when I tote, C-notes from different years\nBezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs\nYou ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya\nI send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher\nYou better off with the stupid guys, looking for a coupe to drive\nYou ain't getting nutting, but you french fries supersized\nIt's a damn shame y'all still local, I'm in a million dollar studio layin' my vocals, nigga\nYou still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere\nYou going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life\nAnd your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you\nSomething positive, alright:\nWell, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;\nYou ain't going nowhere\nGet yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb {*gunshot*}\nFucking dirtbag {*gunshot*}7Embed"

Snoop's shit ain't all that\nAnd I get bad bitches now, I even fucked M\u00fda\n(I fucked her first, Game) 50 you a liar,\nSee that's why I hate you, you think you know me\nI'ma tell everybody you shot my homie\nI hope the police get you and you go to jail\nThe feds freeze your accounts so you can't make bail\nI hope everybody on G-Unit go to hell\nWith Eminem, Obie, Stat Quo and D-12\nSo what I was on Change of Heart?, so what I was a stripper?\nSo what I never banged? I'm from Compton, nigga!\nSee 50 Cent LiveGet tickets as low as $144You might also like\nNow horror films, they scare me\nI watch action films very rarely\nWhen it's comedy or it's drama\nIt's starrin' me, no problem\nNow, horror films they scare me\nI watch action films very rarely\nWhen it's comedy or it's drama\nIt's starrin' me, no problem\n\nG-G-G-G-Unot!

Yeah, it's like that\nSee 50 Cent LiveGet tickets as low as $144You might also like\nShorty, you ain't gotta take your panties off\nJust pull 'em to the side\nIf you wanna ride on the roller coaster\nBaby, come on and ride\nIt go up and down and round and round\nStand up or get on the floor\nIt's on tonight, I know what you like\nI know just how to break you off\n\nNow you can ride the horse around the carousel\nExplosions, Trojans, all in the hotel\nPut me to the test, girl, I don't fail\nI work it out without a doubt\nThere's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park\nHave your lusting seductions considered an art\nThrow a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear\nWhatever color you like, you know I don't care\nI really wanna thank ya for attending this affair\nNow go encourage your friends to come have fun here\nI smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere\nAnd your pass is valid all summer, my dear\nSo at your convenience you can always return\nThere's so many tricks to the trade you should learn\nSuck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop\nForget that, grip that, ride it nonstop\nShorty, you ain't gotta take your panties off\nJust pull 'em to the side\nIf you wanna ride on the roller coaster\nBaby, come on and ride\nIt go up and down and round and round\nStand up or get on the floor\nIt's on tonight, I know what you like\nI know just how to break you off7Embed"
