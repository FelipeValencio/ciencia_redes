  "plain": "Having sold over 100 million records worldwide, and holding the solo artist record of 14 Billboard 200 #1 albums, JAY-Z is possibly the most talented, accomplished and respected rapper of all time. In 2023, during the 50th anniversary of hip-hop, JAY-Z was named by Billboard and Vibe magazines as the greatest rapper of all time. He has released 13 studio albums and five collaborative albums over his 30-year career.\n\nBorn Shawn Corey Carter on December 4, 1969, JAY grew up in the Marcy Houses a.k.a. the Marcy Projects in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. At one point, he attended George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School with rappers Busta Rhymes and The Notorious B.I.G. but he dropped out and hustled in the streets. Known as \u201cJazzy\u201d for his laid-back demeanor, he transformed that into JAY-Z while he was also known as Jigga and Jay-Hova.\n\nHe first got into the rap game working with fellow Brooklyn rapper Jaz-O a.k.a. Big Jaz, appearing on Jaz\u2019s 1989 single \u201cHawaiian Sophie\u201d and in the music video. JAY also appeared on stage with Brooklyn legend Big Daddy Kane around the time he appeared on Kane\u2019s 1994 posse cut \u201cShow and Prove.\u201d He also made notable appearances on tracks such as Original Flavor\u2019s \u201cCan I Get Open,\u201d Big L\u2019s \u201cDa Graveyard\u201d and Mic Geronimo\u2019s \u201cTime To Build,\u201d which also featured early appearances by JAY\u2019s future Def Jam labelmates Ja Rule and DMX. This led to the independent release of his 1995 debut single \u201cIn My Lifetime\u201d with \u201cI Can\u2019t Get Wid Dat\u201d as the B-side.\n\nJAY-Z released his debut album Reasonable Doubt in 1996, but his stock rose with his third album, 1998\u2019s Vol 2\u2026 Hard Knock Life, which was his first #1 album on the Billboard 200, certified 5x platinum and won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. He released an album every year from 1996 through 2004 \u2014 the last in this succession being his second collaborative album with R. Kelly, Unfinished Business, following their 2002 album The Best of Both Worlds. Starting in 1998, all of his subsequent albums through 2009\u2019s The Blueprint 3 reached the top of the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nThree of his albums, Reasonable Doubt, The Blueprint, and The Black Album, are considered landmarks in the genre, with all of them featured in Rolling Stone\u2019s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Hov has won 24 Grammy Awards from 88 nominations, making him the 10th most awarded artist of all time.\n\nLegendary for never writing down his lyrics, JAY-Z\u2019s flow is considered one of the greatest to grace the genre, his wordplay and metaphorical ability is unmatched, and his live shows push the envelope of what it means to be a hip-hop artist. His MTV Unplugged appearance introduced the idea of having a full band (The Roots) backing up a hip-hop artist at major concerts, and during his 2004 documentary Fade to Black he doubled down, selling out Madison Square Garden (in mere minutes) while featuring an enormous live band performance.\n\nSince slowing down his musical production, JAY has become a highly successful investor and entrepreneur. In 2016 Forbes estimated his net-worth to be $610 million, thanks to investments in a chain of 40/40 Clubs, champagne Armand De Brignac, the Barclays Center, the Brooklyn Nets, and cognac D'USSE, among other business and property deals. He also founded the sports agency Roc Nation Sports and is a certified NBA and MLB sports agent. In 2015 he purchased and re-launched the music streaming service Tidal, aiming to change the way streaming services interact with and compensate artists. JAY-Z reached billionaire status in 2019.\n\nA New York Times best-selling author, JAY-Z married legendary R&B singer Beyonc\u00e9 in 2008, with whom he has three kids: daughter Blue Ivy (born 2011), daughter Rumi and her twin brother Sir Carter (born 2017). JAY-Z & Beyonc\u00e9 have appeared on each other\u2019s songs and released the collaborative album Everything is Love in 2018 as THE CARTERS.\n\nThrough his labels Roc-A-Fella Records and Roc Nation, and as the former President of Def Jam Recordings, JAY has played a large role in the success of many other popular artists. Kanye West first gained wide recognition for his production work on The Dynasty, and the two released their collaborative album Watch the Throne in 2011. Artists such as Rihanna, Ne-Yo, J. Cole, Just Blaze, Jeezy, Rick Ross also have JAY to thank in-part for their success.\n\nIn 2001, he was involved in a highly publicized beef with Queensbridge legend Nas that resulted in JAY\u2019s \u201cTakeover\u201d and Nas' \u201cEther\u201d before the two squashed the beef in 2005 and went on to work together on tracks such as \u201cBlack Republican\u201d and \u201cSuccess.\u201d JAY-Z has achieved pop stardom with tracks like his Alicia Keys collaboration \u201cEmpire State of Mind,\u201d which became his first #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2009. His 2013 collaboration with wife Beyonc\u00e9, \u201cDrunk In Love,\u201d made it to #2 on the Billboard charts. 2004\u2019s rap/rock crossover Collision Course, with Linkin Park, also went to #1 and sold 300,000 copies in its first week.\n\nBe sure to check out his life story (in lyrics), and Genius' ranking of the 25 greatest JAY-Z verses of all time."

I'm at the cleaners\nLaunderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh\nShout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church\nWhen I heard you got booked, that shit hurt\nFeel for you bro, we know the system don't work\nTake a young nigga freedom over some dirt\nYet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny\nBlack entrepreneurs, free enterprise\nThat's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap\nThat's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that\nAll these people was gon' kill me, heh\n'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me\nWelcome back Carter, smile\nLiving in the shadow\nCan you imagine what kind of life it is to live?\nIn the shadows people see you as happy and free\nBecause that's what you want them to see\nLiving two lives, happy, but not free\nYou live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love\nThe world is changing and they say it's time to be free\nBut you live with the fear of just being me\nLiving in the shadow feels like the safe place to be\nNo harm for them, no harm for me\nBut life is short, and it's time to be free\nLove who you love, because life isn't guaranteed\nSmile28Embed"

Knock me down\n\nArm, leg, leg, arm, head \u2013 this is God body\nKnowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality\nFood, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace\nHappiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets\nConspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati\nThey can't believe this much skill is in the human body\nHe's 6'2\", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?\nAw, fuck it, you got me\nQuestion religion, question it all\nQuestion existence until them questions are solved\nMeanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh\nMorocco smoking hashish with my fellowship\nY'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo\nYellow shit, color of Jell-O shit\nHello bitch, it's me again\nFresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and\nYou might also like\nHave you ever been to heaven?\nHave you ever seen the gates?\nHave you bowed unto your highness?\nAnd do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down\n\nThat's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight\nLosing my religion, losing my religion\n\nGetting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?\nHave mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini\nI'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down\nY'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition\nAnd God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova\nFrom the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up\nI confess, God in the flesh\nLive among the serpents, turn arenas into churches\nI'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's\nThese are verses from the Bible\nTell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet\nSmoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice\nYou gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates\nI had luggage, meaning I had baggage\nNiggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters\nOnly God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh\nHave you ever been to heaven?\nHave you ever seen the gates?\nHave you bowed unto your highness?\nAnd do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down\n\nHeaven or Hell, the cards we been dealt\nAre the cards that we play, play, play\nDie for what you believe, only one god recedes\nWhen the shots spray, spray, spray31Embed"

(Uh)\nForever young (Young), I wanna be forever young (Forever young)\n(Ayy, may the best of your todays be the worst of your tomorrows)\nDo you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young\n(But we ain't even thinkin' that far, ya know what I mean?)\n\nSo we living life like a video (Video)\nWhere the sun is always out and you never get old\nAnd the champagne's always cold and the music's always good\nAnd the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood\nAnd they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car\nWithout a wrinkle in today 'cause there's no tomorrow\nJust a picture-perfect day that last a whole lifetime\nAnd it never ends 'cause all we have to do is hit rewind\nSo let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine\nReminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind\nLeave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time\nSo when the director yells cut, I'll be fine\nI'm forever young\nYou might also like\nForever young, I wanna be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?\nForever young, I wanna be forever young (Forever young)\nDo you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young\n\nFear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive\nLife is for living, not living uptight, 'til you're somewhere up in the sky\nFear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's\nAre not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive\nThrough the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots\nMy name shall be passed down to generations\nWhile debating up in barbershops\nYoung slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here\nWith a little ambition, just what we can become here (Yeah)\nAnd as the father pass the story down to his son's ears\nYoung'll get younger every year, yeah\nSo if you love me, baby, this is how you let me know\nDon't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby\n\nForever young, I wanna be forever young\nDo you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?\nForever young, I wanna be forever young (Forever young)\nDo you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young\n(Just let it run)\nSlamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches\nPopping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (Hold up)\nNiggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit\nI be talking more shit, they nauseous (Hold up)\nI'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit\nAnd I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit\nLess than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in\nDid you get the picture yet?\nI'm painting you a portrait of Young\n\nForever young, I wanna be forever young (Forever young)\nDo you really want to live forever, forever?

Fuck naw\nWhere all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots\nAnd if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not\nI'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not\nLet outsiders violate our blocks and my plot\nLet's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh\nLet's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh\nAnd sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy\nFlow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!\nYou know it's hell when I come through\nThe life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2\nY'all niggas get ready!\nYou might also like\nIt's the hard knock life for us\nIt's the hard knock life for us\nInstead of treated, we get tricked\nInstead of kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life!\n\nI flow for those 'dro'ed out\nAll my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house\nWe live in hard knocks\nWe don't take over, we borrow blocks\nBurn 'em down and you can have it back\nDaddy, I'd rather that\nI flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition\nI see your vision, mama\nI put my money on the longshots\nAll my ballers that's born to clock\nKnow I'ma be on top whether I perform or not\nI went from lukewarm to hot\nSleepin' on futons and cots to King Size\nGreen machines, to green 5's\nI've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills\nThen I put it down type Braille\nI'm tight grill with the phony\nRappers, y'all might feel we homies\nI'm like, \"Still, y'all don't know me.\"\nShit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'\nI'm tryna murder everything movin' \u2013 feel me?\nIt's the hard knock life for us\nIt's the hard knock life for us\nInstead of treated, we get tricked\nInstead of kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life!\nIt's the hard knock life for us\nIt's the hard knock life for us\nInstead of treated, we get tricked\nInstead of kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life!\n\nI don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes\nGot a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes\nHustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress\nYou'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me\nI gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out\nDidn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out\nSo I stretched the game out, etched your name out\nPut Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!\n\nIt's the hard knock life for us\nIt's the hard knock life for us\nInstead of treated, we get tricked\nInstead of kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life!62Embed"

I can dodge a jab\nThree shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that\nI'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back (Sup Big?)\nAnd the whole BK, nigga, holla back!\nThank God for granting me this moment of clarity\nThis moment of honesty\nThe world'll feel my truths\nAll through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse\nI gave you Volume after Volume of my work\nSo you can feel my truths\nI built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out\nWay beyond a Reasonable Doubt\nY'all can't fill my shoes\nFrom my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending\nListen close, you'll hear what I'm about\nNigga, feel my truths38Embed"

Riddle me that\nThe rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at\nCan't none of y'all mirror me back\nYeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime\nI'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead\nBack to take over the globe, now break bread\nI'm in Boeing jets, Global Express\nOut the country, but the blueberry still connect\nOn the low, but the yacht got a triple deck\nBut when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep\nGrand openin', grand closin'\nGoddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again\nWho you gon' find doper than him?\nWith no pen, just draw off inspiration\nSoon you gonna see you can't replace him\nWith cheap imitations for these generations\nYou might also like\nNow, can I get an encore? Do you want more?\nCookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy\nSo for one last time, I need y'all to roar\nNow what the hell are you waitin' for?\n\nLook what you made me do! Look what I made for you!\nKnew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you\nWhen you first come in the game, they try to play you\nThen you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you\nFrom Marcy to Madison Square\nTo the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)\nAs fate would have it, Jay's status appears\nTo be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye\nWhen I come back like Jordan\nWearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you\nIt's to aim at you, probably maim you\nIf I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens\nCocksucker, take one for your team!\nAnd I need you to remember one thing (One thing)\nI came, I saw, I conquered\nFrom record sales to sold-out concerts\nSo, motherfucker, if you want this encore\nI need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore\nOw, it's star time\nThis man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys\nDo y'all want more of the Jigga man?\nWell, if y'all want more of the Jigga man\nThen I need y'all to help me bring him back to the stage\nSay \"Hova!\", c'mon, say it!\nAre y'all out there?

A daughter\nWho cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her\nAs she cares about ME!\u201d\n\nLet's do this for these babies\nMercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres\nBlatantly ballin' on HD\nY'all need to step up y'all AV\nLife changed again I was already taking off\nMy flight changed again\nSlight change of winds\nIt's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again\nBaby need Pampers\nDaddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons\nPlease don't judge me, only hugged the block\nI thought my daddy didn't love me\nMy baby getting chubby\nCue that Stevie Wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely?\nNow I'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly\nAnd I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby\nFuck joint custody, I need a joint right now\nJust the thought alone fucks with me\nYou might also like\nHigh on life\nI could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor\nApologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter\nIf it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest\n\n\"Don't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.\"\n\nI dream filthy (My mom and pops)\nMixed me with Jamaican (Rum and whiskey, what a set off)\nAnd I know I'm not perfect baby\nI done been through so much trauma, it gonna be hard to reverse it\nWith some doctors and some nurses maybe\nTeach me on how to treat a lady, open doors on the 'Cedes\nThis relationship shit is complicated\nAll I know if we ain't speaking everyday, I fucking hate it\nI don't wanna duplicate it\nI seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin' crazy\nAnd I got that nigga blood in me\nI got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me\n\nHigh on life\nI could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor\nApologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter\nIf it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest\n\"No... wire... hangers... EVER!\"\n\nFather never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother\nI don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another\nBaby with no daddy want no momma drama\nI just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer\nOut in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower\nAnd a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us\nFor the beauty that you be Blue be\nLooking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears\nCheer up, why can't you just be happy\nWithout these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy\nBadly I just wanna spent more time with him\nSadly life wouldn't let me get around with him\nNow I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps\nCut the cord watch her take her first breath\nAnd I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared\nBut in life and death if I ain't here\n\nHigh on life\nI could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor\nApologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter\nIf it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest21Embed"

Nope\nY'all fell into the booby trap\nI set the trap just to see dude react, and now\nAnd now, you's can't leave\nYou opened the door, God, I'm at you annually\nAnd I'm sorry, Ms. Rosie Perez\nI call a spade a spade, it just is what it is\nBut you can't give cred to anything dude says\nSame dude to give you ice and you owe him some head\nShorty, it's time to wake up the dead\nYou sound a little na\u00efve in them articles that I read\nYou might also like\nH-O-V-A\nThe Blueprint 2, baby, on the way\nH-O-V-A\nI got my mojo back, baby, \"Oh, behave\"\nH-O-V-A\nThe Blueprint 2, baby, on the way\nH-O-V-A\nI got my mojo back, baby, \"Oh, behave\"\n\nCan't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of T.D.

Are you not entertained?\"\n\"Is this not why you are here?\"\n\nTurn the music up, turn me down\nGuru, let's go get 'em again\nThis time it's for the money, my nigga\nBrooklyn, stand up\n\nThere's never been a nigga this good for this long\nThis hood or this pop, this hot or this strong\nWith so many different flows, this one's for this song\nThe next one I switch up, this one will get bit up\nThese fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy\nThey don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me\nYou know what? Soon they forget where they plucked\nTheir whole style from then try to reverse the outcome\nI'm like, \"TAA!\"\nI'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others\nI say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin' up my brother\nBiggin' up my borough, I'm big enough to do it\nI'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish\nSo them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out\nIt's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth\nI'm in, new sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas\nWhat more can I tell you? Let me spell it for you:\nW-I, double-L, I-E\nNobody truer than H-O-V\nAnd I'm back for more, New York's ambassador\nPrime Minister, back to finish my business up\nYou might also like\nWhat more can I say?\nWhat more can I do?\nI gave this up to you\nI know this much is true, true, true\nMy love\n\nWhat more can I say to you? You heard it all\n\nYou already know what I'm about: flyin' birds down south\nMovin' wet off the step, purple rain in a drought\nStuntin' on hoes, brushin' off my shirt\nBut ain't nothin' on my clothes 'cept my chain, my name\nYoung H-O, pitch the yay faithful\nEven if they patrol, I make payroll\nBenz paid for, friends they roll\nPrivate jets down to Turks and Caicos\nCris' caseloads, I don't give a shit\nNigga, one life to live, I can't let a day go\nBy without me bein' fly, fresh to death\nHead to toe 'til the day I rest\nAnd I don't wear jerseys, I'm 30-plus\nGive me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button-ups\nS. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete\nWhat more can I say? Guru, play the beat\nMy nigga, hahahaha, woo!\nWe gon' let this ride into the hook\n- I'ma snap my fingers on this one\nWhat more can I say to you?\n- Get my grown man on\nLet's go!\n(What more can I say?)\n\nNow you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag\nFor like half a billy and your ass ain't lily-White\nThat mean that shit you write must be illy\nEither that or your flow is silly, it's both\nI don't mean to boast, but damn, if I don't brag\nThem crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass\nThe Martha Stewart that's far from Jewish\nFar from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it\nAnd no I'm not through with it\nIn fact, I'm just previewin' it\nThis ain't the show, I'm just EQin' it\nOne-two and I won't stop abusin' it\nTo groupie girls: stop false accusin' it\nBack to the music, the Maybach roof is translucent\nNiggas got a problem, Houston!\nWhat up B, they can't shut up me\nShut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride\nGod forgive me for my brash delivery\nBut I remember vividly what these streets did to me\nSo picture me lettin' these clowns nitpick at me\nPaint me like a pickany\nI will literally kiss TT in the forehead\nTell her, \"Please forgive me,\" then squeeze into your forehead\nI'm not the one to score points off, in fact\nI got a joint that'll knock your points off\nYoung Hova the God, nigga, blast for me\nI'm at the Trump International, ask for me\nI ain't never scared, I'm everywhere, you ain't never there\nAnd nigga, why would I ever care?\nPound for pound, I'm the best to ever come around here\nExcludin' nobody, look what I embody:\nThe soul of a hustler, I really ran the street\nA CEO's mind, that marketin' plan was me\nAnd no, I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times\nOr make up shit in a whole bunch of lines\nAnd I ain't animated like, say, a Busta Rhymes\nBut the real shit you get when you bust down my lines\nAdd that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times\nTimes that by my influence on pop culture\nI'm supposed to be number one on everybody list\nWe'll see what happens when I no longer exist\nFuck this man\nWhat more can I say?19Embed"

The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.\n\nThey say \"They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone.\"\nSo on that note, I'm leavin' after this song\nSo you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long\nBut at least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on\nI was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves\nWho made love under the sycamore tree\nWhich makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim\nAt 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain\nAlthough through the years I gave her her fair share\nI gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here\nShe knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care\nBut I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear\nNow I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there\nWas a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared\nI went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted\nBut I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted\nHold on\n\nShawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.\nYou might also like\nNow, all the teachers couldn't reach me\nAnd my momma couldn't beat me\nHard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me\nSo, with that disdain in my membrane\nGot on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came\nThen DeHaven introduced me to the game\nSpanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now\nMy gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd\nAnd all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now\nMy self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag\nGot a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged\nPlus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had\nSupposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass\nI'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap\nBut that came second to me movin' this crack\n\"Gimme a second, I swear,\" I would say about my rap career\n'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!\n\nShawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.\n\nGoodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush\nYour blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush\nAnd you in a drop, you're so easy to touch\nNo two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much\nAnd \"trust\" is a word you seldom hear from us\nHustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up\nAnd the drought will define a man when the well dries up\nYou learn the worth of water without work\nYou thirst 'til you die, yup!\nAnd niggas get tied up for product\nAnd little brothers' ring fingers get cut up\nTo show mothers they really got 'em\nAnd this was the stress I lived with\n'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven\nFor every bad decision I made, every sister I played\n\u2018Cause I'm still paranoid to this day\nAnd it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made\nThis is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me\nIf you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade to black\nIf you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade to black\nNow if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade to black\nIf you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when I fade...46Embed"

(Brooklyn)\nUh-huh huh  (Brooklyn)\nRespect this here, check!\n\nI'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come\nYou and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme\nWhere the grams was slung, niggas vanish every summer\nWhen the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run\nWhere the plans was to get funds and skate off the set\nTo achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet\nFaced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets\nSo I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check\nI'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much\nAnd girls from the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much\nSo they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust\nI don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us\nI'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable\nBoosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new\nYour word was everything, so everything you said you'd do\nYou did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it\nI'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about\nWho's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas?\nWhere the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds\nAt each other's throats for the love of foreign cars\nWhere cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's\nBut most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?\nI'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars\nI'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all\nYou might also like\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Brooklyn... so where you from?)\n\nI'm from the place where the church is the flakiest\nAnd niggas been praying to God so long that they atheist\nWhere you can't put your vest away\nAnd say you'll wear it tomorrow\n'Cause the day after we'll be saying\n\"Damn, I was just with him yesterday\"\nI'm a block away from hell\nNot enough shots away from stray shells\nAn ounce away from a triple beam\nStill using a hand-held weight scale\nYou're laughing, you know the place well\nWhere the liquor stores and the base dwell\nAnd government? Fuck government! Niggas politick theyselves\nWhere we call the cops the A-Team\n'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things\nAnd life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens\nWhere how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies\nSo tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize?\nIf the shit is lies, God strike me\nAnd I got a question:\nAre you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know\nOne day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know\nThe stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto\nPromise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Brooklyn... so where you from?)\n\nCheck, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards\nLost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen\nI'm up the block, around the corner and down the street\nFrom where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet\nWe make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep\nAnd fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet\nNiggas get lost for weeks in the street, twisted off leek\nAnd no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat\nWhether you're four-feet or Manute size\nIt always starts out with three dice and \"shoot the five\"\nNiggas thought they deuce was live, then I hit 'em with trips\nAnd I reached down for their money, pa, forget about this\nThis time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist\nAnd this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this\nNiggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs\nBefore you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood\nWhere I'm from\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)\nCough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice\n(Brooklyn...)15Embed"

(Oh)\nNasty shit, you thought I was boning Renette\nYou calling Carm' (Hello) a hundred times (Hello), I was (Hello) boning her neck (Call me back)\nYou got a baby by the broad, you can't disown her yet\nWhen does your lies end? When does the truth begin?\nWhen does reality set in, or does it not matter?\nGotta hurt: I'm your baby mama's favorite rapper (Haha)\nAnd ask your current girl, she know what's up\nHolla at a real nigga! Jigga! (I don't give a fuck!)\nAll I really know is your ho wants to be with me\nAnd she ain't playing\nAnd what I'm saying (She creeps with me)\nAnd sleeps between the sheets\n\"That's all right.

(Yes you can!)\nCan I kick it? (Yes you can!)\nCan I kick it? (Yes you can!)\nWell I'm gone... check this out\n\nToo much West Coast dick lickin'\nAnd too many niggas on a mission, doin' your best Jay-Z rendition\nToo many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions\nThat you're just fish in a pool of sharks, nigga, listen\nToo many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a ho\nI'ma call you a ho, too many bitches are shady\nToo many ladies give these niggas too many chances\nToo many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is\nToo many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances\nNo question; Jay-Z got too many answers\nI been around this block too many times\nRocked too many rhymes, cocked too many nines, too\nTo all my brothers it ain't too late to come together\n'Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever\nI don't follow any guidelines 'cause too many niggas ride mine\nSo I change styles every two rhymes\nYou might also like\nHah, what the fuck\nThat's 22 two's for y'all motherfuckers out there, nahmean?\nShall I continue?

But you know I do wanna say somethin' to you, I know you've been havin' a lot of problems with the law\nBut I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%\nMad Wednesdays, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dame Dash, Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back any time!\n(Hah, thanks a lot)\nWait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Ace, turn that music down. I smell some reefer, now you see? That's why, our people don't have anything, because we don't know how to go in places and act properly\n(Hey, shut the fuck up!)\nWait a minute, wait a minute, who told me shut the eff up? Who told me to shut the eff up? Get him out of here! I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out! Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech!\nThank you, he's out of here now, now like I was sayin'... we gotta build our own businesses, we gotta get our own record companies goin' like Roc-A-Fella Records, we got to put money back into our own community...15Embed"

Like you work that hard to stay the same\nUhh! Game stays the same, the name changes\nSo its best for those to not overdose on being famous\nMost kings get driven so insane\nThat they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did\nNo dangers, so shameless\nInvited to the inner sanctum of your chambers\nLow chain 'em as the enemies approach\nSo raise your draw bridge and drown them in the moat\nAnd the Spirit I'm evoking\nHold on\n\nEverybody screaming they want the old Hov\nBut the new improved Hov hit like Albert Pujols\nEverybody wanna hear me talk that money like Phil Rizzuto\nBut my mind is on Pluto\nBills that I do fold, I now invest on\nTrying to find some loopholes in the IRS\nAs where I used to have a few hoes, I am just\nConcentrating on making a new Hov through sex\nI've awakened just in time to school those putos\nTrying to follow in my shoes with jewels froze\nBetter adhere to this text 'fore you go\nBroke, spending more than you've accrued on silly baguettes\nI know silly begets silly you'll learn on your own\nAt least my conscience is clear, I'm no longer steering you wrong\nAin't nothing wrong with baguettes after you get a home\nTake care of your home, you can go back and\u2014ugh!\nI'm getting courted by the bosses\nThe Edgars And Doug Morris-es-es\nJimmy I's and Lyors-es -- it's\nGotta be more than the choruses\nThey respecting my mind now\nJust a matter of time now\nOperation: Takeover Corporate\nMakeover offices-es-es then takeover all of it\nPlease may these words be recorded\nTo serve as testimony that I saw it all before it\nCame to fruition, sort of a premonition\nUncontrollable hustler's ambition\nAlias Superstition, like Stevie\nThe writing's on the wall like my lady, right baby?\nSaw it all before, some of y'all thought I was crazy, maybe\nLike a fox, I'm cagey, ah-ah\nThe more successful, the more stressful\nThe more and more I transform to Gordon Gekko\nIn the race to a billion got my face to the ceiling\nGot my knees on the floor, please Lord forgive him\nHas he lost his religion, is the greed gon' get him?\nHe's having heaven on earth, will his wings still fit him?\nI got the Forbes on my living room floor\nAnd I'm still talking to the poor, nigga I want more\nTIME's most influential, was impressive\n'Specially since I wasn't in the artist section\nHad me with the builders and the titans\nHad me right with Rupert Murdoch\nBillionaire boys and some dudes you never heard of\nWord up on Madison Ave is I'm a cash cow\nWord down on Wall Street, homie, you get the cash out\nIPO Hov, no need for reverse merger\nThe boy money talk no need to converse further\nThe baby blue Maybach like I own Gerber\nBoardroom I'm lifting ya skirt up21Embed"

What, nine weeks and you're home?\"\nHe said: \"Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home.\"\nI just sat, spat no more speech in the phone\nThem crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'\nI said: \"The world don't stop, I got to keep, keep on.\"\nFrom there I sensed the beef was on\nI ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone\nTo see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone\nCan't be too safe, \u2018cause niggas is two-faced\nAnd they show the other side, when they catch a new case\nIt's on\nYou might also like\nIt was cool when you had hella weed to smoke\nAnd you bought a new home where you could keep the folks\nI don't see how this side of you could be provoked\nUh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago\nFunny what seven days can change\nA stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim\nUsed to have a firm grip, now you dropping names\nIt was all good just a week ago\n\nLike I put the toast to your head and made you sell\nWe both came in this game, blind as hell\nI did a little better, had more clientele\nTold you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail\nSeventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill'\nI could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal\nHad niggas thinkin' I was from uptown for real\nI had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill\nLike a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville\nDown and dirty, down to fight to round 30\nFreezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack\nLookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?\nCame from flat broke to lettin' the dough stack\nYou tell them Feds I said: \"I'm never going back\"\nI'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats\nYou know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious\nIt was cool when you had hella weed to smoke\nAnd you bought a new home where you could keep the folks\nI don't see how this side of you could be provoked\nUh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago\nFunny what seven days can change\nA stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim\nUsed to have a firm grip, now you dropping names\nShit was all good just a week ago\n\nThe lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things\nAll this after a week in the bing\nI'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling\nI would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing\nNigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke\nEven pricked our finger, anything that got between us\nWe supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?\nInstead you copped out to a misdemeanor\nFuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)\nThe same game that make you math could make you die\n(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap\nWho would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?\nNow you know that's bad when your sister is mad\nAnd your son gotta grow up, like, \"This is my dad?\"\nThe labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar\nYou'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars\nIt was cool when you had hella weed to smoke\nAnd you bought a new home where you could keep the folks\nI don't see how this side of you could be provoked\nUh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago\nFunny what seven days can change\nA stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim\nUsed to have a firm grip, now you dropping names\nIt was all good just a week ago\n\nShit is crazy man\nAll these niggas out here snitchin'\nWe was one step away from takin' this crack money\nAnd recyclin' it through the ghettos\nAnd buildin' back up our own hoods\nNow all you niggas start snitchin' on each other\nI got partners doin' 15-20\nWouldn'ta been doin' SHIT\nIf you didn't snitch, beatch!\nIt's about time y'all check that shit out man\nIt ain't all good, shut your mouth\nJust watch the game\nAnd don't snitch\nWe'd sure go a lot whole further\nBelieve that baby\nJay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house mane\nYou know I got it\nGot it goin' on\nWe got the money\nAin't got nuthin' to do with crime baby\nBut I'm recognizin'\nYou rat bastard!16Embed"

Ha, I know\nI know what y'all niggas asking yourself\nIs he gon' ever fall off?\nNo...\n\nA lot of speculation\nOn the monies I've made, honies I've slayed\nHow is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?\nHustlers I've met or, dealt with direct\nIs it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC?\nWhat's the position you hold?\nCan you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck\nBut only a single goin' gold?\nIf Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold\nIs it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O?\nFor the millionth time, asking me questions\nLike Wendy Williams, harassing me\nThen get upset when I catch feelings\nCan I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave\nWhile I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve\nUgh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?\nLike you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?\nWhat you doin in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses?\nLatinos and Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico\nI'll answer all your questions but then y'all got to go\nNow the question I ask you is, \"How bad you wanna know?\"\nBLAOW!\nYou might also like\nA million\n\nRoc-A-Fella y'all, uhh, uh\nKnow my style\n\nMotherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more\n'Til I'm no more, 'cause I'm so raw\nMy flow expose holes that they find in yours\nWasn't for me, niggas still be dying for whores\nBut I hate when a nigga sit back, admiring yours\nYoung blood, you better get that, we frying because\nNiggas don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse\nAnd don't listen to the rappers yo, they dying to floss\nI used to be O.T., applyin' the force\nShoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss\nCome back with the clique playing Diana Ross\nI'm the boss and this is how it's gon' be\nBurnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V\nI got mouths to feed 'til they put flowers on me\nAnd kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise\nTombstone read, \"He was holdin' no leaks\"\nStarted from the crack game and then sold sweet\nFreaked it to the rap game, Jigga the O.G\nOn MTV, telling 'em how I sold D\nAnd used to bag work up out of apartment 4-B\nMe and my homie, started out co-d's\nPicked the mailbox lock 'cause I ain't have no key\nHad the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'\nThen I went low key, but now I'm back, it's on\nMotherfuckers!\nJigga, uh-huh, yeah\nRoc-A-Fella y'all, uuuh\nUhh, feel this22Embed"

Is that necessary?\nYou know you've become a star\nBecause you're the biggest target out there, right?\nWhen everyone's on the court, they're coming for you\nWhen the opposing player walks into that arena\nThey're thinkin of upstaging you\nYou're, you're like a trophy to them\nThey're thinkin' \"if I'm better than this guy\nThe spotlight turns on me\"\nSo, you know you're a superstar because you're a marked man\nAnd everyone's coming for you\n\nThe, the, the king\nThey wanna be the, the, the king\nThey wanna be the, the, the king\nThey wanna be the, the, the king (king)\n\nInspired by Basquiat, my chariot's on fire\nEverybody took shots, hit my body up, I'm tired\nBuild me up to break me down to build me up again\nThey like \"Hov', we need you back so we can kill your ass again\"\nHov got flow though he's no Big and Pac, but he's close\nHow I'm 'posed to win? They got me fighting ghosts\nMost kings (... get their heads cut off)\nWith the same sword they knight you they gon' good night you with\nShit, that's only half if they like you\nThat ain't even the half what they might do\nDon't believe me, ask Michael\nSee Martin, see Malcolm\nSee Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome\nSee Jesus, see Judas\nSee Caesar, see Brutus\nSee success is like suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nWhen you succeed, prepare to be crucified, uhh\nMedia meddles, niggas sue you, you settle\nEvery step you take, they remind you you ghetto\nSo it's tough being Bobby Brown\nTo be Bobby then, you gotta be Bobby now\nNow the question is, \"Is to have had and lost\nBetter than not having at all?\"\nBecause dawg\nYou might also like\nMost kings get their heads cut off\nKeep on climbing 'til you reach the top\nKeep on coming if they ready or not\nMost kings get their heads cut off\nThe, the, the king\nThey wanna be the, the, the king\nThey wanna be\n\nUhh, everybody wanna be the king then shots ring\nYou laying on your balcony with holes in your dream\nOr you Malcolm X-d out, get distracted by screams\nEverybody get your hand off my jeans\nEverybody look at you strange, say you changed\nLike you work that hard to stay the same, uhh\nGame stays the same, the name changes\nSo it's best for those to not overdose on being famous\nMost kings get driven so insane\nThat they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did\nSo dangerous, so no strangers\nInvited to the inner sanctum of your chambers\nLoad chambers, the enemy's approaching\nSo raise your draw bridge and drown 'em in the moat\nThen, spirit I'm evoking\nThere's kings who've been awoken\nFrom shots from those who was most close to them\nThey won't stop until you ghost to 'em\nBut real kings don't die\nThey become martyrs, let's toast to 'em\nKing Arthur, put a robe to him\nLike James Brown, no the show ain't over\nUntil Rome's ruined\n'Til the republic is overthrown\n'Til my loyal subjects is over Hov'\nLong live the king, no, the reign won't stop\nThey want my head on the chopping block\nI won't die, nah\nMost kings get their heads cut off\nKeep on climbing 'til you reach the top\nKeep on coming if they ready or not\nMost kings get their heads cut off\nKeep on coming if they ready or not\nLong live the king, know the reign won't stop\nThe, the, the king\nThey wanna be the, the, the king\nThey wanna be\nLong live the, the, the king\nThey wanna be the, the, the king\nThey wanna be\nMost kings get their heads cut off\nKeep on climbing 'til you reach the top\nKeep on coming if they ready or not8Embed"

Allow me to retort\nYou cowards is just now learnin' the shit that we taught\nYou niggas ain't know about a Robb Report\n'Bout a high-speed Porsche\nI.e., you niggas ain't know how to floss\n'Til I came through the door like \"Eric B. for Prez\"\nRespect me in this bitch!\nYou can't disrespect us \u2018cause you got a little check cut\nYou was sucking 'em so long, fucking your lil' neck up\nNow you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches\nYou think you Hugh Hef', but you just ridiculous\nI blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game\nIt's only right I got the right to be king\nNiggas that got life really like what I sing\n\u2018Cause they know what it's really like, niggas feel my pain\nKnow the shit I don't write\nBe the illest shit that's ever been recited in the game\nWord to the hyphen in my name!\nJ-A-Y, Dash, Hoffa\nThe past, present, nigga, the future, proper\nThe Holy Trinity in hip-hop is us\nWe give Dre his props, but that's where it stops\nIt's the Roc!\nYou might also like\nI know\nYou got your eyes on me\nI feel you watching me\nBut it ain't hard to see that you can't see me\nYou try\nBut what you think you saw\nAin't what you thought you saw\nYou better off not looking at all\n\nEverywhere that I go\nAin't the same as before\nPeople I used to know\nJust don't know me no more\nBut everywhere that I go\nI got people I know\nWho got people they know\nSo I suggest you lay low\nI'm still on top of the game\nStill droppin' flames, still cock and aim\nStill at the top, had to rock for the fame\nOver setbacks, there's been a lot since I came\nYou seen it all, how I got, how I gained\nThe momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain\nWhen I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim\nThe streets, they made a special spot for my name\nDre, haters want a stop to my reign\nBut the music lives in me, every drop in my veins\nThe pride and the pain\nAll the way back from the rise of my name\nSee the world clear through the eyes of the man\nSee the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave\nWhen the beat bangs, it'll drive 'em insane, the odds that I played\nThe best to emerge in the game: it's The Watcher\nI know\nYou got your eyes on me\nI feel you watching me\nBut it ain't hard to see that you can't see me\nYou try\nBut what you think you saw\nAin't what you thought you saw\nYou better off not looking at all\n\nEverywhere that I go\nAin't the same as before\nPeople I used to know\nJust don't know me no more\nBut everywhere that I go\nI got people I know\nWho got people they know\nSo I suggest you lay low\n\nI'm rated R, my brain contains graphic things\nIt turn traumatic teens into addicts and fiends\nIt's like watching a movie through a panoramic screen\nWhich means I can see the whole planet in the scene\nCash is the topic\u2014the object? A fatter pocket\nSome take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it\nTake away to add a profit, it's catastrophic\nI take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it\nThese New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully\nThe world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me\nYo, my neighborhood is never sunny\nIn the place where the number one cause of death is money\nYou can try coping\nI seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken\nI'm still alive and scoping\nBe another hundred years 'til my skies close in\nAnd I'ma die with my eyes open\u2014The Watcher\nI know\nYou got your eyes on me\nI feel you watching me\nBut it ain't hard to see that you can't see me\nYou try\nBut what you think you saw\nAin't what you thought you saw\nYou better off not looking at all\n\nEverywhere that I go\nAin't the same as before\nPeople I used to know\nJust don't know me no more\nBut everywhere that I go\nI got people I know\nWho got people they know\nSo I suggest you lay low\n\nThe Watcher\nThe Watcher\nI'm watching, The Watcher\nBah, bah, The Watcher\nThe Watcher22Embed"

Dot\nAnd I ain't never been to jail; I ain't never pay a nigga\nTo do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself\nI will never tell, even if it means sittin' in a cell\nI ain't never ran, never will\nI ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands\nTo himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt\nI never asked for nothin' I don't demand of myself\nHonesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth\nDeath before dishonor and I tell you what else\nI tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help\nFoolish pride is what held me together through the years\nI wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself\nI just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt\nBefore God and asked for better cards at times to no avail\nBut I never sat back feelin' sorry for myself\nIf you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell\n'Til it's heaven\nYou might also like\nJustify my thug for you\nMy thug (hoping)\nMy thug (praying) for you\nTo justify my thug\nMy thug (hoping)\nMy thug (praying) for you\nFor you\n\nNow if you shoot my dog, I'ma kill yo' cat\nJust the unwritten laws in rap, know that\nFor every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin'\nRelaxin's what I'm about, but about mine\nDon't be actin like you can't see street action\nTake me back to Reasonable Doubt time\nYou see my mind's on the finish line, facin' the wreck\nI put my muh'fuckin' faith in the TEC, tell Satan not yet\nYou understand I am chasin' my breath\nI am narrowly escapin' my death, oh yes\nI am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster\nTravellin' Mach 5, barrel in my apparel can stop God\nGod forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you\nUntil, I won this race, then eventually\nMy engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me\nHowever it turns out fine, red line!\nJustify my thug for you\nMy thug (hoping)\nMy thug (praying) for you\nTo justify my thug\nMy thug (hoping)\nMy thug (praying) for you\nFor you\n\nThey say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight\nAnd two wrongs don't make a right\nBut when you been wronged and you know all along that it's just one life\nAt what point does one fight? (Good question, right?)\n'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in his\nTen-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half\nBet that stops all the grinnin' and the laughs\nWhen you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag\nWhen your options is none and the pen is all you have\nOr the block, niggas standin' tight as lemons on the ave\nTryin' to cop a shop - call theyself cleansin' in the cash\nBut can't put they name on paper 'cause, then you on blast\nMr. President, there's drugs in our residence\nTell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us\nMr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up\nEvery other corner there's a liquor store, fuck is up?\nJustify my thug for you\nMy thug (hoping)\nMy thug (praying) for you\nTo justify my thug\nMy thug (hoping)\nMy thug (praying) for you\nFor you11Embed"
