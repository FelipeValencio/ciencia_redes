  "plain": "Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. (born September 27, 1982), better known by his stage name Lil Wayne, grew up in the Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nAt the age of nine, Lil Wayne joined Cash Money Records as the youngest member of the label, and half of the duo, The B.G.\u2018z, with B.G.. In 1997, Lil Wayne joined the group Hot Boys, which also included rappers Juvenile, B.G., and Young Turk. Lil Wayne gained most of his success with the group\u2019s major selling album Guerrilla Warfare, released in 1999. He has been listed in the 2012 Guinness Book Of World Records for the record of Most US Hot 100 Hits By A Rap Artist with 64 hits between 1999 and 2010.\n\nWayne is famous for his command of slow, witty lines and metaphorical jokes. His discography includes a slew of successful mixtapes, including Dedication 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6; No Ceilings; and Da Drought 3. His albums consistently garner acclaim, with Tha Carter series all platinum hits. Tha Carter series has been a work of Wayne\u2019s for 13 years and continues to grow with the fifth installment, Tha Carter V released in 2018 (however, it was initially supposed to be released in late 2014). Wayne keeps a regular recording schedule, with studio booths in his tour bus, home, and following him everywhere."

Let your tongue show\nMoney over bitches, and above hoes\nThat is still my favorite love quote\nPut the gun inside, what the fuck for?\nI sleep with the gun, and she don't snore\nWhat the fuck, yo? Where the love go?\nTrade the ski mask for the muzzle\nIt's a blood bath, where the suds go?\nIt's a Swizz beat, there the drums go\nIf she's iffy, there the drugs go\nIf she sip lean, double-cup toast\nI got a duffle full of hundos\nThere the love go, where's the uproar?\nSee Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like\nWhat the fuck though?

It's where I'm from, bro\nWe grow up fast, we roll up slow\nWe throw up gang signs, she throw up dope\nDreadlock hang down like you dun know\nPut the green in the bag like a lawnmower\nHair trigger pulled back like a cornrow\nExtra clip in the stash like a console\nListenin' to Bono, you listen to Donald\nWhat the fuck, bro? Where the love go?\nSwizzy, he the chef, I like my lunch gross\nJust look up, bro, there the Scuds go\nI see the shovel, but where did bruh go?\nHmm, to the unknown\nOnly way he comin' back is through his unborns\nIf you see what's in my bag, think I'm a drug lord\nIt's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?\nWhat the fuck though? Where the love go?\nFive, four, three, two, I let one go\nBow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro\nAimin' at your head like a buffalo\nWhat the fuck though? Where the love go?\nFive, four, three, two, I let one go\nBow! Get the fuck though, I don't bluff, bro\nAimin' at your head like a buffalo39Embed"

I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell\nUsed to say, \"Fuck the police,\" now I say, \"Fuck jail\"\nSame shit, different air freshener\nI don't play, boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner\nTryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind\nTwo fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind\nI be in the cloud, cloud number nine\nAnd I just fucked the clock and let it come with time\nIt's a cold world, I put on a mink\nThere's a chain of commands, I'm the missin' link\n\nGod bless Amerika\nThis ole' godless Amerika\nI heard tomorrow ain't promised today\nAnd I'm smokin'on them flowers, catch the bouquet\nHere, we live by the sword and die by the sword\nHeard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad\nShootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket\nI'm wired out the socket, but still shockin'\nEverybody wanna tell me what I need\nYou can play a role in my life but not the lead\nI saw a butterfly in Hell today\nWill I die or go to jail today?62Embed"

I made the loot\nWhen money went from army green to navy blue\nI said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof\nSometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too\nMan, I'ma need some Krazy Glue\nHer walls is what I'm breaking through\nHer nails, she gon' break a few\nYou can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you\n(Errr!)\n\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken\nOut of all the rankless, I was chosen (Yeah)\nWhen all of the lights they get low (Low)\nAnd all of the curtains they close (They close)\nYou cannot break down (You can't) what can't be broken (Uh)\nSee Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like\nG-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code\nWe bros (Can't be broken)\nYeah, we bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes\nG-code (Can't be broken)\n\nI ain't finna break or fix the brakes, you emulate\nI'm laughing in your face, now fix your face, I can't disintegrate\n'Cause I facilitate a mil' a day for like a million days\nAt least the bills are paid, the children safe, want to get away?\nNo, I'm here to stay, I'm really great, but don't discriminate\n'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face\nYou stickin' out your chest, your titties fake\nDon't make me pick your fate\nI'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced\nThe heart was built to break\nI'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake\nI got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case\nMy killers straight, let's do some Q&A\nYou saw the news today, got news to break and rules to break\nIt hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break\nIt's worth the wait, commercial break\n\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)\nOut of all the rankless, I was chosen\nWhen all of the lights they get low\nAnd all of the curtains they close\nYou cannot break down what can't be broken (Uh)\nG-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code\nWe bros (Can't be broken)\nYeah, we bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes\nG-code (Can't be broken)27Embed"

Foxy, coffee\nBrown as the bosom I flew in on\nNose round like the wheels that my rims spin on\nLips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait, it wasn't\nOh, and I forgot, I'll take a microwave or oven\nSo we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin\nMaybe bake a dozen\nMy homeboy like your sister, maybe they can bake some cousins\nOoh, isn't that sweet?\nYou feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass\nSee Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like\nThis is not a love song, this is a you song\nI just happen to love you\nThis is not a love song, this is a you song\nI just happen to love you\nThis is not a love song, this is a you song\nI just happen to love you\nThis is not a love song, this is a you song\nI just happen to love you\n\nGive you the world if it was for me\nMy diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth\nAnd now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds\nThinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile\nI get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track\nYou say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act\nBut anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it\nSorry, my mind in the gutter\u2014better yet, sewer\nAnd when you say I love you, I stutter, \"I-I love you too\"\nIt's Wayne's world, she say, \"What is this world coming to?\"\nAnd she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose\nShe told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce\nI laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other\nThen she got serious and said, \"Tune I gotta ask you something\nDo you really love me?\" I tried to change the subject\nSo I said some crazy shit to her like\n\"What if you and I were just letters?\nThat'd be unfortunate, we'd have to rob a fortune teller\nBut I swear, I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket\nOkay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie\nYou remind me of... my memory ain't what it used to be\"\nShe said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet\nAnd when she figure out that she been swindled\nI'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window\nI-I love you too...\nThis is not a love song, this is a you song\nI just happen to love you\nThis is not a love song, this is a you song\nI just happen to love you\nThis is not a love song, this is a you song\nI just happen to love you\nThis is not a love song, this is a you song\nI just happen to love you\n\nI mean how many times\nHow many times I gotta\nHow many times I gotta say it for it to count?\nAre you counting?\nI loved the pictures\nI needed that, I swear I did\nI was just thinking about you when you sent them too\nYou don't believe me?

My reason?\n\nNaked bitches really love ones\nSometimes our loved ones don't love us\nI'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love\nSometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber\nI just tell my lady, \"Nothing's easy\"\nEven though I make it look easy\nBut understand looks are deceiving\nLookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance\n'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it\nCranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it\nGotta synchronize it, tranquilize it\nDoctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'\nPain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me\nTryna hang my body, sanctifyin'\nI'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die\nI can't deny it, you can't tame my lion\nI'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it\nFeel like a anchor tied to my finger\nGot me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink\nI know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas\nThere's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength\nI talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga\nSo, I look death up in her eye and then I wink\nIt's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real\nI hope it gave you chills\nThe dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill\nYou don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real\nGettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL\nShow up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em\nPrice tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em\nIce bath when my face numb, no expression\nWhat's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?\nMama told me, \"Fuck the world and be so aggressive\nBe self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive\nDon't get too high to look over blessings\nNever come in second, make the most of your seconds\nThey so precious\"\n'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it\nIf you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling\nI keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic\nWhere the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache\nLookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better\nI was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter\nDear Life\nWhat is my meaning? My reason?\nThat's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader\nDear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?\nThat's the question\n\nYou know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, \"Y'all young. You know y'all young.\" But I said, \"Be the best father you can be,\" you know. And truly, he is that.18Embed"

Penney's\nI got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it\nIf we winning, win it\nI know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it\nSo I had to tint it and I had to rim it\nAnd I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny\nIt's the Blood gang, it's the money gang\nRed rags to riches, need happy endings\nThen it's back to business, and we laugh at sentencing\nHungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses\nHungry artist or a starving artist\nIn the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias\nDon't make a difference if you taste the difference\nBetter pay the difference to the racketeerers\nNow your good luck looking like you cracking mirrors\nNow the artificial become sacrificial\nThat's a body count, where the mathematician?\nWhere the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?\nWith an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle\nWith a throat deep enough to land a missile\nIf your nigga miss you and he have opinions\nTell him two cents is only half a nickel\nNow we at his villa aiming at his pillows\nHair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles\nAnd the cash, it triple; flip, kick, jiujitsu\nThrowing pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit\nNeither of her friends do, I think that's official\nGot my neighbor's eyes bigger than The Simpsons\nAnd her man a simper, so I had to pimp her\nAnd she had potential but he lacked credentials\nSo give me a sec, I'll go at your neck\nAnd send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!\nYeah, cannibalism, going animalistic in a land of civilians\nThese niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons\nOnce they dead and gone, no paraphernalia\nWhen she left her thong, that's paraphernalia\nSound familiar? My plug Sicilian\nHe the one who told me that sometimes\nYou gotta leave your la familia behind the millions\nRhyme or reason, I'm the reason\nGot their eyes wide, but too blind to see it\nWith friends like those, it make me text all my enemies\nAnd tell 'em I don't need 'em\nHallelujah, power intruders\nBitch walking 'round my house like Hooters\nTowel user, power user\nMolly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan\nNiggas talking out their bowel movers\nTurn their homies into flower choosers\nTurn your kids into father choosers\nMake your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar\nI'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter\nClap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo you\nTell a doc that's tryna save your life and running wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!\nI'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter\nLet her partner shoot it\nWe put out the movie, win awards\nShe got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty\nNiggas prostituting\nThese rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution\nAin't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in\nChange in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it\nEn route to Houston with the contribution\nFull of Monster juices, Mazda too slow\nMacho, Cujo, macho mucho\nBig bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!\nI got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo\nJust follow the coupe, ho, and I know that you know\nI'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl\nI'm out of my loophole, you out of the loop though\nGot all these niggas on silent and mute mode\nThe power to do so, my pockets is sumo\nGetting the mula by the minuto\nMafia Nouveau, I am the uno\nReal boss nigga, should model for Hugo\nFuck with me, I go Lollapaloo-zo\nPull up, trigger finger, holler, and pull-o\nPow-pow-pow, sound like a symphony\nOr opera, two-door, hitting some new notes\nAnd I am the maestro, and you just a typo\nPrivate flight, don't fly in too low\nI'm wiser than you know, a private school flow\nI got me a new ho, and now it's a duo\nOne went to college and one went to JuCo\nI had to ask 'em, \"What's four plus two, though?\" Rrr!\nSee Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like\nMy ultimate basketball dream team\nThe starting five would most likely be umm\nOf course I'ma have to start with Kobe Bryant, umm\nThis gone take a minute, umm, Chris Paul\nUhh, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James\nAnd umm, oh you know I'm gon say Steph Curry, hehe, Steph Curry\nYou already know that's my starting five, I got money on them\nHolla at ya boy20Embed"

What's in your pocketbook?\nWe think the Bible's a comic book\nBitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood\nToo Hollygrove to go Hollywood\nI got cocaine that's so good, need a name?

King Freestyle Lyrics\nAyy, the blues is now kickin', and dinner is three Michelin\nI don't eat red meat, but still got beef sizzlin'\nKnow that I need discipline\nI keep singin' for all these hoes, they keep listenin'\nNiggas love to bro up with the boy and dap fists-es\nBut we are not equivalent, dawg\nI been an only child, don't need siblings\nAnd I'm past them like the times that he's livin' in, okay\nMan, if you saw what I flew here, you'd be like, \"He's sickenin'\"\nIf you not runnin' some top, we not gon' keep kickin' it\nClassics, I keep scribblin', lights in the Universal building just keep flickerin'\nMoney just keep comin' in, you would think I'm Irish the way that it stays doublin'\nI could feed a country with the tax that I pay governments\nWhat\u0435ver they're doin' with my cash is v\u0435ry troublin'\nOkay, February came around, I used to get paid shovelin'\nSold clothes, walked dogs, trust me, I stay hustlin'\nWhen it came to school, there's no way that I'm A-plus-in' it\nSo I just dropped out of it, trust me, I'm not proud of it\nNiggas get too comfy in they spot, they get knocked out of it\nNiggas get a gun just so they can make props out of it\nShawty make a scene in the house, she get locked out of it\nYeah, you not 'bout to be chillin' in this bitch with kicked feet up\nI'ma make you bounce out this ho like Big Freedia\nPete O. used to throw a purple tint on a two-liter\nFirst private plane I ever rode was a eight-seater\nBefore that, I got the bedroom hot with a space heater\nOn top of that, I didn't have shit to my name either, that's real\nBut now I'm givin' house tours 'til it's back to world tours\nPlay that \"Mask Off\" when they find the real cure\nI might not be good for her, but I'm real to her\nGot no time for her, but give Richard Mille to her\nThat's the only way I know how to express love\nMy dawgs love sticks and drums like they Questlove\nAll them jokes about Aubrey, they got me messed up, for real\nI come with a lot of complications inside me\nIt's always people misleadin' me that are tryna guide me\nEveryone wants to try me, but no one wants to buy me\nEveryone wants to meet me, but no one wants to keep me\nEveryone talkin' lemons when everything is peachy\nEveryone got they hands out, and it ain't to reach me\nSee Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like\nMhm, yeah, mhm\nEveryone got they glass out, let's drink to Weezy\nEvery nigga that stare me down just came to see me\nChoppin' up a lil' cash cow, that's steak I'm eatin'\nCheck deposits, high-risers with extra closets\nThe sex platonic, I talk intelligent, text Ebonics\nThe electronic guitars whinin', that's just Nirvana\nTommy gun on the counter, I call it Mr. Thomas\nThat'll keep niggas honest\nI'm dozin' off in the driver seat 'cause the seat give massages\nDecimal point money, these numbers too steep for commas\nI'm eye to eye with niggas, I can't help but to see beyond 'em\nGot a two-seater problem\nNiggas thinkin' they cold, I knock the flu-season out 'em\nBitches forget they hoes, and that's when Tunechi remind 'em\nI used to fuck Gucci models, I'm fuckin' Gucci designers\nI keep it too G regardless, I'm gettin' too deep for divers\nLet me resurface, I'm flexin' on purpose\nShe especially curvy, bet she be servin' every purpose, perfect\nI'm better than perfect, I'm sick, I need to see a medical person\nEatin' all of these rappers with these edible verses\nAll I gotta be is all that I can possibly\nShe really, really into me, then suck it all up out of me\nI'm proud of me, I don't know how to be sorry, apologies\nYou fuckin' with my math, you better know some trigonometry\n'Cause I'ma be bustin', leave your lima bean at your mama feet\nI flip the economy like Dominique Dawes\nThey say I'm trippin', I guess they wishin' I finally fall\nI don't need war, I need a bitch that know I'ma need yours\nI'ma need more, niggas is shifty like Honda Accords\nFire alarm, ain't got no ceilings, we climbin' the walls\nHigher than yours, I fuck your bitch and she die in my arms\nLion has roared, No Ceilings 3 with my mind on the fourth\nHolla at your boy10Embed"

   "lyrics": "105 ContributorsDontGetIt Lyrics\nBaby, you understand me now\nIf, sometimes, you see that I'm mad\nDon't you know no one alive can always be an angel?\nWhen everything goes wrong, you see some bad\n\nBut I'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood\n\nUgh, what\u2019s understood ain\u2019t got to be explained\nBut you don't understand me, so let me explain\nHeh, stood in the heat, the flame\nThe snow, \"Please, slow down, hurricane\"\nThe wind blow, my dreads swang\n\"He had hair like wool, like Wayne\"\nHuh, dropping ashes in the Bible\nI shake 'em out, and they fall on the rifle\nScary, Hail Mary, no tale-fairy\nAll real, very extraordinary\nPerry Mason facin' the barrel if he tattle\nMy God is my judge; no gown, no gavel\nA hound, a rebel, down to battle\nNow or never, or whenever, and the F for...\n\"Fucking fantastic\"\u2014fuck if you agree\nI'm bright, but I don't give a fuck if you see me\nSee Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like\nBut I'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood\n\nUgh, what's understood ain't got to be explained\nSo for those who understand, meet Dwayne\nFor eight and a half months I gave Miss Cita pain\nNow it's Young Money, baby\u2014keep the change\nMy mama say, \"Fuck 'em!\" And we the same\nSo hello, motherfucker, you got some sheets to change\nAnd ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday?\nYou know; church fit, then out-fit\nBright pink and green chest look house-lit\nBright pinky rings, but that ain't about this\nWhat you 'bout, bitch?\nExcuse my French emotion and my passion\nBut I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion\nWhat are you askin'? If I don't have the answer\nIt's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula\nBut I know you don't understand\n'Cause you thought Little Wayne was Weezy, but Weezy is Wayne\n\nBut I'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood\n\nI'm watchin' TV the other day, right? Got this white guy on there talking 'bout Black guys. Talking about how young Black guys are targeted. Targeted by who? America.\nYou see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up. One in every nine Black Americans are locked up. And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college.\nSee, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only... I don't want to say only right, but, shit... only logic by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found\u2014you know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucker to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; Level 3, Level 4 drugs, shit like that.\nMhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood, and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood, huh? Yeah.\nYou know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared. I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the Level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out.\nAnd what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track. That's the good weed.\nYou know what? I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him? Meaning, he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then, you move in a sex offender. Hahaha. Then give me a paper. Haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.\nAnother thing. Let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh... Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.\nMhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, \"'spec before check,\" anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha.\nHold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhm, hold on, um...\nMr. Sharpton, and anyone like you: You don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!\nBut, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. But I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha.\nYou see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him\nFuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!\n\nBut oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nOh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood37Embed"

What we got\nYour first patient (Yeah)\nIs suffering from a lack of concepts (Uh-huh)\nOriginality (Ugh)\nHis flow is weak (Another one)\nAnd he has no style (Ugh)\nWhat you got for him? (Tssss, okay)\n\nLet me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on\nDr. Carter to the rescue\nExcuse me if I'm late, but like a thief it takes\nTime to be this great, uhh, so just wait\nYour style is a disgrace, your rhymes are fifth place\nAnd I'm just grace, one, uno, ace\nAnd I'm trying make your heart beat like bass\nHmm-mm, but you're sweet like cake\nAnd I come to fix wherever your shell break\nWhere is your originality? You are so fake\nSo picture me like a gallery, capture what I say\nAll I need is one mic, all I need is one take\nLike, hey, brighter than a sun ray\nGot a pistol on a playground, watch the gun-play\nLike, no kidding, no kids in the way\nBut the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say\nGotta work everyday, gotta not be clich\u00e9\nGotta stand out like Andre 3K\nGotta kick it, kick it like a sensei\nYou gotta have faith, you gotta, gotta\nWait, wait, I think I, I think I lost him\n(Dial 118 please)\nSee Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like\nGood afternoon, Dr. Carter (Nurse)\nI don't know about this one\nHis confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work\nAnd he lacks respect for the game\n(Uh, let me see)\nYou think you can save him?\n\nOkay, respect is in the heart, so that's where I'ma start\nAnd a lot of heart patients don't make it\nBut, hey kid, plural, I graduated\n'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it\nAnd that was called recycling, r-e-reciting something\n'Cause you just like it, so you say it just like it\nSome say it's biting but I say it's enlightening\nBesides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest\nAnd Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest\nAnd Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest\nArthritis in my hand from writing\nBut I'm a doctor, they don't understand my writing\nSo I stopped writing, now I'm like lightning\nAnd you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titan\nFast and exciting, my passion is frightening\nNow let me put some more vocab in your IV\nHere, take this Vicodin, like it and love it\nAnd confidence has no budget\nSo pay me no mind, I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it\nI don't do it 'cause I done it, and I'm in the emergency un-it\nGod dunnit I've lost another one\nGood evening, Dr. Carter. It's been a long day\nBut this one looks much better than the others\nHis respect is back up, concepts sound good\nHis style is showing strong signs of improvement\nAll he needs now is his swagger\nOkay, let me take my gloves off then\nSwagger tighter than a yeast infection\nFly, go hard, like geese, erection\nFashion patrol, police detection\nEyes stay tight like Chinese Connection\nI stay tight like pussy at night\nBaby, don't get me wrong, I could do that pussy right\nBut I'm too wrong to write, too fresh to fight\nToo paid to freestyle, too paid to freestyle\nHad to say it twice, swagger so nice\nAnd don't ask me shit unless it concern a price\nAnd I don't rap fast, I rap slow\n'Cause I mean every letter in the words\nIn the sentence of my quotes\nSwagger just flows sweeter than honey oats\nThat swagger, I got it, I wear it like a coat\nWait, as I put the light down his throat\nI can only see flow, his blood starting to flow\nHis lungs starting to grow, this one's starting to show\nStrong signs of life, where's the stitches? Here's the knife\nSmack his face, his eyes open, I reply \"What a night\"\n\"Welcome back, Hip-Hop, I saved your life\"\nHe looks good, his vitals are up\nHe's looking good, he's looking good\nI think we got one\nDr. Carter, I think we got one\nYep, yep, we got one, we saved him, he's good\nHe's good, we got one, he's good\nHe's good, we got him\nWe saved him, he's a go\nHe's good36Embed"

Am I rising?\nBut why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?\nWhy can't I trust what I see? (MonstaBeatz)\n\nMy-my scene just a crime scene\nGot the high beams and the sirens, yeah\nMy team, we divide teams\nTalkin' dirty money? Check the hygienes\nAll the dirty money get dry cleaned\nTalkin' dirty money, Sam Rothstein\nHad my goons kidnap your offsprings\nWhile I was working on my golf swing\nOoh, sweet dreams, sour nightmares\nIt's a cold world, I got an ice grill\nNo one man should have all that power\nIf he can't afford to pay the light bill\nI got a forcefield over my heartbeat\nThe window seal with no door key\nI'm poppin' pills to feel more me\nCut off the wings now I'm soaring\nAnd I never feel like poor me\nI'd rather feel like the old me\nI was born with wheels and I roll deep\nI could make the devil get cold feet\nDon't light the clove unless it's four leaf\nGet a pussy wetter than a coral reef\nOn my face, I tatted me a fleur-de-lis\nShould I get it covered with a coca leaf?\nI could tell you better than you showed me\nI could show you better than you told me\nI'm an OG up in OT\nAnd it's no sleep 'til it's roast beef\nI better not hear a Little Bo-Peep\nBetter go figure, better go deep\nPass no judgement, pass your weed\nI'm the GOAT nigga, no goatee\nSee Lil Wayne LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also like\nWhy me?

I was the illest nigga on child support\nNow I'm lookin' at the Robb Report\nWent and looking at the final score\nBedroom got revolvin' doors\nBitches in and out smilin' more\nThan children smilin' at a carnival\nAin't got nothing in common but the common cold\nBig Bs nigga, honor roll\nHold up, I think I found the flow\nStarted from the bottom bitch\nNever been monogamous, never been monotonous\nNever been anonymous, money is eunonymus\nAlways had accomplices, always had conglomerates\nAlways let the chopper clip stick out like a bottom lip\nYou runnin' out of time so you better know what time it is\nYou runnin' out of tears and you runnin' out of volunteers\nYoung Mula bitch, I die for the logo\nCocaine price low, call that a low blow\nTunechi like Pablo, kis in the rowboat\nTunechi in the yacht though, still don't showboat\nSippin' on the slowpoke, movin' like a tugboat\nSmokin' like a steamboat, fuckin' on a love boat\nBetter read the ransom note before you read the love note\nDon't know if it's sore throat, deep throat or cut throat\nWhy me?

Am I rising?\nBut why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?\nWhy can't I trust what I see?\n\nOh why am I so kamikaze\nWhy can't I stay in my seat? I'm so hyphy\nTry me, why do I see these bloody bodies?\nWhy do I love what I see?\nWhy me?
