  "plain": "The ubiquitous Kanye West\u2014from his famous quip, \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people,\u201d to interrupting Taylor Swift\u2019s speech, to marrying Kim Kardashian (and later divorcing her), to announcing that he\u2019s running for President, to admitting his love for President Trump, to proclaiming that there were admirable things about Hitler\u2014it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s a staple of the tabloids and the entertainment world, industry-wide.\n\nThat certainly doesn\u2019t take anything away from his music; as a matter of fact, it only seems to add to his fortuitous career. For instance, his 2010 album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, was universally praised by fans and critics alike; it was recorded smack dab in the middle of the backlash received from his Swift interruption and his break-up with then-girlfriend Amber Rose.\n\nHe has scored countless well-known hits, as well, from each of his previous studio albums\u2014such as \u201cStronger,\u201d \u201cHeartless,\u201d and \u201cGold Digger.\u201d Each of his albums have been massive critical and commercial successes, including his collaboration album with JAY-Z, Watch the Throne. As of 2022, West has won an astounding 24 GRAMMYs, as the most decorated hip-hop artist in Grammy history, he splits this title with his big brother JAY-Z, who has won 24 GRAMMYs too. And yet he doesn\u2019t have seem to take too much pride in this fact.\n\nKanye\u2019s sixth solo album, Yeezus, polarized his fan base and the general public but was heaped with rave reviews by music critics for its experimental production. In 2016, West released his seventh and most delayed body of work, The Life of Pablo, which was illegally downloaded over 500,000 times, frustrating fans after its TIDAL-exclusive release. West notably updated the album multiple times on TIDAL after its release.\n\nQuite possibly West\u2019s most surprising contribution to the music industry was his production streak during the summer of 2018, in which he produced five albums. Among these was a collaborative project with Kid Cudi, titled KIDS SEE GHOSTS; along with his eighth studio album, ye, which tied Eminem and The Beatles for eight consecutive chart-topping releases.\n\nThe public\u2019s love for Kanye West has been apparent from the get-go, and each of his solo albums, barring his 2004 debut, The College Dropout, has peaked at #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album Chart. Another major standout, 2008\u2019s 808s & Heartbreak, is largely credited with influencing the next generation of rappers; from the emphasis on heavy beats and melodic instrumentals to its heavy usage of auto-tune.\n\nHis ninth studio album, Yandhi, was originally scheduled to be released on September 29, 2018, and then again on November 26, 2018. However, West rescheduled the album release, because he felt it wasn\u2019t finished yet, and eventually seemed to completely scrap and recycle its components into a new album. Songs from Yandhi have been reused in later Kanye albums such as Donda and Jesus is King as well as Travis Scott\u2019s Utopia.\n\nOn August 29, 2019, Kim Kardashian-West teased a new Kanye album tracklist via Twitter, with the title Jesus is King.  Kanye seemed to confirm this by clearing his official website and posting the same image of the tracklist with the expected drop date at the bottom, September 27, 2019; almost a year after Yandhi was supposed to be released. However, the release was delayed to October 25, 2019, to release along with his accompanying documentary.\n\nFurthermore, after years of claiming he would run for President, he finally announced so on Twitter which was met with much controversy, many claiming it was merely a publicity stunt for his forthcoming album, Donda.\n\nOn August 24, 2021, West applied to have his name changed from Kanye Omari West to Ye, he cited \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d for the change, and on October 18, 2021, the request was granted. West had been alluding to this wish to change his name since 2018, and had used Ye as a nickname for several years prior. In a June 2018 interview, he explained:\n\nI believe \u2018ye\u2019 is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible it means you. So, I\u2019m you. I\u2019m us. It\u2019s us. It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye. Just being a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused \u2013 everything. It\u2019s more of a reflection of who we are [as] beings.\n\nFollowing the overwhelming release of Donda, the album was further introduced to a sequel, which was further campaigned publicly on January 27, 2022. The album was met with an unfamiliar approach \u2014 only being supported on his Stem Player device \u2014 after his departure from Def Jam. It was debuted at a concert, which showcased the incomplete album, and then left as it was."

(Ah)\n\nBitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker\nFat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble\nAs you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles\nKanye West samples, here's one for example\n\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nProfit, profit, nigga, I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands\nUh, the best living or dead hands down, huh\nLess talk, more head right now, huh\nAnd my eyes more red than the devil is\nAnd I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch\nMatter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this\nDo the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists\nAnd my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit\nArguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit\nI heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain\nBought the chain that always give me back pain\nFuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane\nChi nigga, but these hoes love my accent\nChick came up to me and said, \"This the number to dial\nIf you wanna make your number one your number two now\"\nMix that Goose and Malibu, I call it \"Malibooyah\"\nGoddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style\nKnow that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?\nWhatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now\nKnow I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now\nThink you motherfuckers really, really need to cool out\n'Cause you'll never get on top of this\nSo, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this\nHave you ever had sex with a pharaoh?\nAh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus\nNow she claiming that I bruised her esophagus\nHead of the class and she just won a swallowship\nI'm livin' in the future so the present is my past\nMy presence is a present, kiss my ass\nYou might also like\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (Yeah)\nProfit, profit, nigga, I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands\nSasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness\nGoblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience\nQuestion, what do these things all have in common?\nEverybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nConquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense\nNonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is\nNone of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen\nI still hear fiends scream in my dreams\nMurder, murder in black convertibles, I\nKill a block, I murder the avenues, I\nRape and pillage your village, women and children\nEverybody want to know what my Achilles heel is\nLove, I don't get enough of it\nAll I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers\nAll I see is these niggas I made millionaires\nMillin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air\nAll I see is these fake fucks with no fangs\nTryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins\nI smell a massacre\nSeems to be the only way to back you bastards up\nGossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nProfit, profit, nigga, I got it\nEverybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert\nI'ma need to see your fuckin' hands\nPull up in the monster, automobile gangsta\nWith a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka\nYeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka\nYou could be the king, but watch the queen conquer\nOkay, first things first, I'll eat your brains\nThen I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs\n'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do\nHair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do\nMonster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe\nYoung Money is the roster and a monster crew\nAnd I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face\nAnd if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't\nSo let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?\nBut my features and my shows ten times your pay?\n50K for a verse, no album out\nYeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it\nHotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent\nTony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it\nNicki on them titties when I sign it\nThat's how these niggas so one-track-minded\nBut really, really, I don't give an F-U-C-K\n\"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake\"\n\"She on a diet,\" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake\nAnd I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play\nJust killed another career, it's a mild day\nBesides, Ye, they can't stand besides me\nI think me, you, and Am' should m\u00e9nage Friday\nPink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash\nI think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast\nNow look at what you just saw, this is what you live for\nAh, I'm a motherfuckin' monster!\nI, I crossed the limelight\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide\nAnd I, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home (Headed home)\nI, I crossed the limelight\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)\nAnd I, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home (Head home)\nI, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)\nAnd I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide\nAnd I, I wouldn't last these shows\nSo I, I am headed home\n415Embed"

Real friends\nIt's not many of us, we smile at each other\nBut how many honest? Trust issues\nSwitched up the number, I can't be bothered\nI cannot blame you for havin' an angle\nI ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing\nHope you're doin' your thing, too\nI'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions\nFuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion\nSpillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined\nIn town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?\nWho your real friends? We all came from the bottom\nI'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem\nDamn, I forgot to call her, shit, I thought it was Thursday\nWhy you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?\nWhen was the last time I remembered a birthday?\nWhen was the last time I wasn't in a hurry? Uh\n\nTell me you want your tickets when it's gametime\nEven to call your daughter on her FaceTime\nEven when we was young, I used to make time\nNow we be way too busy just to make time\nEven for my\nYou might also like\nReal friends\nI guess I get what I deserve, don't I?\nWord on the streets is they ain't heard from him\nUh, I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?\nTalked down on my name, throwed dirt on him\nI couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)\nCouldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)\nI got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)\nPlus I already got one kid (Kid)\nCouldn't tell you much about the fam, though\nI just showed up for the yams, though\nMaybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister\nMerry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business\nYou wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)\nLike I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)\nPlease don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)\n'Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children\nOh, you've been nothin' but a friend to me\nNiggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me\nIt's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries\nTo be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy\nMoney turn your kin into an enemy\nNiggas ain't real as they pretend to be\nLookin' for real friends (Real friends)\nHow many of us? How many of us are real friends\nTo real friends, 'til the reel end\n'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin? (Yeah, yeah-yeah)\nTo 3 A.M., callin'\nHow many real friends?\nJust to ask you a question\nJust to see how you was feelin'\nHow many?\nFor the last you was frontin'\nI hate when a nigga text you like, \"What's up, fam? Hope you good\"\nYou say, \"I'm good, I'm great,\" the next text they ask you for somethin'\nHow many?\nWhat's best for your family, immediate or extended?\nAny argument, the media'll extend it\nI had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on\nPaid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him\nReal friends\nHuh?\n\nReal friends\nI guess I get what I deserve, don't I?\nWord on the streets is they ain't heard from him\nUh, I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?\nTalked down on my name, throwed dirt on him264Embed"

to nobody\nAnd at this rate, we gon' both die broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say no\nPeople tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter\nMy friends' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin'\nThe media said he's way out of control\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past 25\nYou might also like\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nYeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah\n\nI've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come\nA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums\nI believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, \"How my neck look?\"\nWell, it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (Real!)\nI've been woken from enlightened man's dream\nCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\n'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego when confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' me\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\n'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo\nShe got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo\nModern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow\nNightlife, walk all over me\nWalk all over me\nI'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring\nFly, fly, fly overseas\nFly overseas\nOh, anywhere, everything but in between\nOh, yeah\n\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\n\nPlease face me when I speak\nPlease say to me somethin' before you leave\nYou've been treatin' me like I'm invisible, now I'm visible to you\nOh, the invisible truth stay sober\nI can't quite understand the games you play\nUnderstand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath\nAnd I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore\nBut I'm cryin' at the bar\nI'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man\nI'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me\nAnd looked at me like you knew me\nBut I feel so alone\nLike I don't know anyone except the night sky above\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\n(Father, Father,

I'm saying\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\nNot for nothing, I've foreseen it, I dreamed it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nNo more chances, if you blow this, you bogus\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\nPenitentiary chances, the devil dances\nAnd eventually answers to the call of autumn\nAll them fallin' for the love of ballin'\nGot caught with thirty rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin\nInter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums\nBased off the way we was branded\nFace it, Jerome get more time than Brandon\nAnd at the airport, they check all through my bag\nAnd tell me that it's random\nBut we stay winning\nThis week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending\nAnd a new beginning and a new fitted\nAnd some job opportunities that's lucrative\nThis the real world, homie, school finished\nThey done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it\nI treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS\nI won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?\nYou might also like\nAin't no question if I want it, I need it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nI'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\nIs hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?\nThe soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing\nBut this is more than just my road to redemption\nMalcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention\nAs long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me\nBut they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me\nI thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me\nIf a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet\nBut this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus\nReady for the world's games, this is my Olympics\nWe make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish\nChoke a South Park writer with a fishstick\nI insisted to get up off of this dick\nAnd these drugs, niggas can't resist it\nRemind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted\nIf I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it\nAin't no question if I want it, I need it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nI'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\nI need more drinks and less lights\nAnd that American Apparel girl in just tights\nShe told the director she tryna get in a school\nHe said, \"Take them glasses off and get in the pool\"\nIt's been a while since I watched the tube\n'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news\nI was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today\nThey rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday\nAnd what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?\nI guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach\nMy guy said I need a different approach\n'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke\nIt's not funny anymore, try different jokes\nTell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O\nAnd kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it\nPlay strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit\nAct like I ain't had a belt in two classes\nI ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it\nI'm coming after whoever, who has it?\nYou blowin' up, that's good, fantastic\nThat, y'all, it's like that, y'all\nI don't really give a fuck about it at all\n'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me\nForgot about two things, my Black balls\nAin't no question if I want it, I need it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nI'm on the edge, so why you playing? I'm saying\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down\nAyy, yo\nI done copped Timbs, lived in lenses, kid\nArmani suits, fresh fruits, Bally boots, and Benzes\nCounting up, smoking, one cuff\nLive as a red Jag', a Louis bag, grabbin' a blunt, fuck it\nSteam about a hundred and one L's\nKites off to jails, buyin' sweats, running up in Stetson\nNigga hat game was special\nIt matched every black pair of Nikes, throwing dice for decimals\nThe older head, bolder head, would train a soldier head\nMake sure he right in the field, not a soldier dead\nThat meant code red, bent off the black skunk\nThe black Dutch, back of the old shed\nIf you can't live, you dying, you give or buy in\nKeep it real or keep it moving, keep grinding\nKeep shining, to every young man, this is a plan\nLearn from others like your brothers Rae and Kanye\n\nNot for nothing, I've forseen it, I dreamed it\nI can feel it slowly drifting away from me\nNo more chances, if you blow this, you bogus\nI will never ever let you live this down, down, down247Embed"

(So high)\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh\nAt the mall, there was a seance\nJust kids, no parents\nThen the sky filled with herons\nSaw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron\nAnd the hell, it wouldn't spare us\nAnd the fires did declare us\nBut after that, took pills, kissed an heiress\nAnd woke up back in Paris\nCan we get much higher?

Chi city!\nI'm comin' home again\nDo you think about me now and then? (Yeah)\nDo you think about me now and then?\n'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)\n-Min' home again\n\nI met this girl when I was three years old\nAnd what I loved most, she had so much soul\nShe said, \"Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but\nMy name is Windy and I like to blow trees,\" and\nFrom that point, I'd never blow her off\nNiggas come from out of town, I like to show her off\nThey like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off\nAnd make 'em straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft\nAnd when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown\nIn the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'\nI told her in my heart is where she'll always be\nShe never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave\nShe said, \"It felt like they walked and drove on me\"\nKnew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me\nI guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me\nShe said, \"Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me\"\nYou might also like\nI'm comin' home again\nDo you think about me now and then?\nDo you think about me now and then?\n'Cause I'm comin' home again\n-Min' home again\nDo you think about me now and then?\nDo you think about me now and then? Oh!\nNow I'm comin' home again\nMaybe we can start again\n\nBut if you really cared for her\nThen you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams\nSometimes, I still talk to her\nBut when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me\nShe said, \"You left your kids, and they just like you\nThey wanna rap and make soul beats just like you\nBut they just not you,\" and I just got through\nTalkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new\nNow everybody got the game figured out all wrong\nI guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone\nI guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home\nAnd guess when I heard that? When I was back home\nEvery interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud\nReach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud\nJump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around\nIf you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town\nI'm comin' home again\nDo you think about me now and then?\nDo you think about me now and then?\n'Cause I'm comin' home again\n-Min' home again\nBaby, do you remember when\nFireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!\nNow I'm comin' home again\n-Min' home again\nBaby, do you remember when\nFireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!\nNow I'm comin' home again\nMaybe we can start again\n\nLoy-oy-al, loy-oy-al\nComin' home again\nLoy-oy-al, loy-oy-al\nComin' home again\nMaybe we can start again105Embed"

Yes sir\nNow is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir\nThough the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest\nBut all they got left is this guy called West\nThat'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def\nCall him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z\nI'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh\nIt come out sweeter than old Sadie\nNice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards\nGirl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards\nAnd I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye\nI'm almost Raymond\nSome say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?\nIt was straight embarrassing how y'all played him\nLast year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine\nEvery motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme\nNow I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem\nOr use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams\nI use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed\nBut without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh\nSo I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more\nYou niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more\nYou can't say shit to Kanye West no more\nI rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga\nI'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don\nBought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom\nI ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards\nI prayed to the skies and I changed my stars\nI went to the malls and I balled too hard\n\"Oh my god, is that a black card?\"\nI turned around and replied, \"Why yes\nBut I prefer the term African American Express\"\nBrains, power, and muscle\nLike Dame, Puffy, and Russell\nYour boy back on his hustle\nYou know what I've been up to\nKillin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit\nMayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips\nAnd I am\n(Here's to the Roc)\nAnd they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them\n(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)\nRaise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and\n(Here's to the Roc)\nThis is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas\n(Mr. Rockefeller)\nSo get your ass up off the wall\n\nSo this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the \"Truth\" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin'?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't Be Life.\"\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\nAnd he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\nYou know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, \"Man that was tight.\"\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them \"Jesus Walks\" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, \"Naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay, man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got 11 plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer-rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you?143Embed"

(Lord)\nMama, you was the life of the party\nI swear you brought life to the party\nWhen you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)\nThat woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)\nVisions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me\nMovin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army\n'Cause they been killin' **** since **** was watchin' Barney (Jesus)\nYou want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)\n'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here\nBeen in the dark so long, don't know if the light here\nBut I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)\nAnd now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)\nI deaded those night terrors when the night clears\nAnd if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?\nAnd if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)\nBut back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)\nYou better have a strategy or you could be a statistic\nLittle boy dies, he's just one of the mystic\nAnd mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)\nAnd she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)\nAnd her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid\nThat's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it\nSixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)\nBut we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)\nBaby shower time, father didn't show up\nNow she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up\nThe water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)\nA year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)\nAnd she's still dependent on her mom\nBig brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun\nHe want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)\nAnd her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)\nIs it real love? Do the scars really heal up?\nFrom all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)\nA week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)\nLeft his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side\nHe seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes\nTo see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)\nEven let him get the last meal\nHe done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)\nHe gotta show him that it's that real\nHe ran up on him with the pipe like, \"****, stand still\" (Jesus)\n\"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry\" (Lord)\n\"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ\"\nHe said, \"Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ\"\nThen big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)\nYou might also like\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\n\nUh-huh, in the name of the true and living God, the beneficent, the merciful (Hallelujah)\nThank you for bringing me up the rough side of the mountain like Ertu\u011frul (Jesus)\nEvery knee bowed and every tongue confessed and paid homage (Lord)\nTo the monk who visited Rothschilds like Thelonious did Pannonica (Shoo)\nIt's Jay Elec-entendre-nica comin' through your monitor\nBack from the great beyond like the Son of Man or the Son of Donda? (Jesus)\nI never rolled the GSXR or the R6 or the Honda (Lord)\nBut I flew my Ducati through North America like Wakanda\nEarthquakes will strike this nation for what Bush did to Rwanda (Facts)\nWhat the Clintons did to Haiti and Downing Street did to Ghana (Jesus)\nIn Tepoztl\u00e1n, they call me Terremoto, El Negro Loco (Lord)\nI shake the tectonic plates of the game if I lay one vocal\nThe God is interstellar while you fellas remain local\nMy bars is like the pyramid temples of Pacal Votan (Jesus)\nAs sure as the DOJ confirmed Ezekiel's Wheel (Lord)\nI could change the world like Yacub with two pieces of steel\nMy sword and my microphone, I swore to the Christ's throne\nBut when you great, they wanna say you took a L, Jos\u00e9 Castillo (Jesus)\nI'm in the fight here, fight here for what seemed like lightyears (Lord)\nMy rugged cross and thorny crowns squeeze out Christ tears\nThirty pieces of silver clout, my Pierre price tier\nIt's a war outside, it's a war outside (Jesus)\nIt's like the last days of Sodom and Gomorrah outside (Lord)\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nNow we've been through a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nHe lives in a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\nBeen through a lot of things\nTell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)\n\nWhat up, Ye? This Larry Hoover Jr\nFirst and foremost, I wanna thank you for taking the fight for my father to the Oval Office\nYou might not have been the only one that could've did that\nBut you were the one that did do that\nAnd with your assistance, we can continue to let the world take part in this fight\nYou know, to me, it kinda feels like\nMe, my mother, my brothers, and my kids\nHave all been incarcerated through this journey\nAnd we haven't even been to jail\nWe have been looked at and treated as criminals\nFor being a part of this family\nMy father's truth and the reality that he raised me in\nIs that he wanted to make a change in this community (Tell me if you know someone that needs)\n'Cause the conditions in this capitalist society is what made him\nAnd it is what made the children of today\nAfter twenty-five years of bein' locked down, twenty-three and one\nMy father has not called any shots from one of the most secure and segregated prisons in the world\nAnd will not, once released, call any shots for the Gangster Disciples\nIf my father's intentions were to lead us to death, destruction\nInto the Hell that he has had to live in for the past twenty-six years\nMan, he would be dead to me\nI didn't sign up for that\nI didn't stay on this journey this long for that\nAll my life, man\nI've been waitin' for my father to come home\nThey told me when I graduate eighth grade, he would be home\nThen they told me when I graduate from high school, he would be home\nI went away to Morris Brown, I graduated and he still ain't home\nNow I'm a adult, and my daughter went away to college and graduated\nHe still not home\nNow even more than that, my son, he graduated eighth grade and we still waitin'\nMatter of fact, he hasn't hugged, kissed, or touched any of his grandchildren\nAnd they haven't been able to touch they grandfather\nEven though it is not seen that way for some of us\nBut for many of us, Larry Hoover is a beacon of hope for his community\nWho deserves to breathe free air\nFree my father (Jesus), Mr. Larry Hoover Sr. (Lord)66Embed"

Forever ever?\nEver, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\n(And ever) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\nGood mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still\nPeople lose hands, legs, arms, for real\nLittle was known of Sierra Leone\nAnd how it connect to the diamonds we own\nWhen I speak of diamonds in this song\nI ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin', I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home\nMy chain, these ain't conflict diamonds\nIs they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane\nSee, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'\nHow when I know what a blood diamond is?\nThough it's thousands of miles away\nSierra Leone connect to what we go through today\nOver here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs\nOver there they die from what we buy from drugs\nThe diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses\nI thought my Jesus piece was so harmless\n'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless\nAnd here's the conflict\nIt's in a black person soul to rock that gold\nSpend your whole life tryna get that ice\nOn a Polo rugby, it look so nice\nHow can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?\nRight? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike\nYou can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because\nYou might also like\nDiamonds are forever\nForever, forever (Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)\nDiamonds are forever\nForever, forever (The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme)\n(Forever) Forever ever?

Ever, ever?\nUh\nPeople askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (Uh)\nThat'll be the same day I give the game back (Uh)\nYou know the next question, dawg, \"Yo, where Dame at?\" (Uh)\nThis track the Indian dance that bring our rain back (Woo)\n\"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?\"\n\nYup\nI got it from here, 'Ye, damn\nThe chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)\nThe name is mine, I'll take blame for that\nThe pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?\nHaha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that\nHow could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?\nI had to get off the boat so I could walk on water\nThis ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me\nDifficult takes a day, impossible takes a week\nI do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)\nI'm guessin' I can sell CDs\nI'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man\nLet me handle my business, damn\nKanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy\nYG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me\nBleek could be one hit away his whole career\nAs long as I'm alive he's a millionaire\nAnd even if I die he's in my will somewhere\nSo he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah\nHe don't even have to write rhymes\nThe Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes\nShirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly\nWhat I been sayin' practically my whole career\nThe diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever\nNow the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better\nPeople lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'\nInstead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix\nIf you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign\nIt would seem like forever is a mighty long time (Ha)\nI'm Young, bitches!\nHahahahaha\nGood night!\n46Embed"

Ivy (Traduzione Italiana)Never Let Me Down Lyrics\nOh baby\nHahahaha\nTurn the motherfuckin' music up\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I've found, one thing I found\nOh, no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\n\nThat's right, it's what I do!\nC'mon, uh-huh\nNah, you know I never let you down!\nGyeah, gyeah, yuh\n\nYo, first, I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts\nFirst, I had they ear, now I have they heart\nRappers came and went, I've been here from the start\nI seen them put it together, watched them take it apart\nSeen the Rovers roll up with ribbons\nI seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven\nSo when I reload, he holds number one position\nWhen you hot, I'm hot\nAnd when your feet cold, mines is sizzling\nIt's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me\n'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life\nThis is not an image, this is God-given\nThis is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'\nIt's the most consistent, Hov\nGive you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and\nNigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'\nIt's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap\nI'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy\nYou might also like\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I've found, one thing I found\nOh, no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up\nI get down for my grandfather who took my momma\nMade her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat\nAt the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins\nAnd with that in my blood, I was born to be different\nNow niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership\nBut we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership\nThat's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it\nRacism still alive, they just be concealin' it\nBut I know they don't want me in the damn club\nThey even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club\nI done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed\nSwear I've been baptized 'least three or four times\nBut in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid\nIt's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved\nLike it take a lot more than durags to get you waves\nNothing sad as that day my girl father passed away\nSo I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter\nAnd you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up\nAnd I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her\nAnd you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up\nBut I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye\n'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye\nFirst Aaliyah, now Romeo must die\nI know I got angels watching me from the other side\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I've found, one thing I found\nOh, no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nGet up, I get down, get up, I get down\nWe are all here for a reason on a particular path\nYou don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math\nCats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious\nThat's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world\nI'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls\nI'm not just another individual\nMy spirit is a part of this, that's why I get spiritual\nBut I get my hymns from Him\nSo it's not me, it's He that's lyrical\nI'm not a miracle, I'm a Heaven-sent instrument\nMy rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental\nThat's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into\nYeah, I need my loot by rent day\nBut that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte\nI'm trying to get us \"us free\" like Cinque\nI can't stop, that's why I'm hot\nDetermination, dedication, motivation\nI'm talking to you of my many inspirations\nWhen I say I can't let you or self down\nIf I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff\nAnd you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life\nIn my grip, I would never, ever let you down\nAnd when these words are found\nLet it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love\nThat's why my breath is felt by the deaf\nAnd while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind\nI, too, dream in color and in rhyme\nSo I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house\n'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth\nA touch of God reigns out\nTake 'em to church\nWhen it comes to being true, at least true to me\nOne thing I found, one thing I found\nOh, no, you'll never let me down\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get\nGet up, I get, get up, I get down\nWho else you know been hot this long?\n(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)\nStarted from nothing but he got this strong\n(The Roc is in the building)\nBuilt the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you\nPedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)\nLet you tell it, man, I'm falling\nWell, somebody must have caught him\n'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em\nNumber one albums, what I got? Like four of them\nMore of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way\nClear the way, I'm here to stay\nY'all can save the chitter chat, this and that\nDissin' Jay, dissin' Jay'll get you maced\nWhen I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious\nSix Hail Marys, 'Please, Father forgive us'\nYoung, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas\nThe way y'all all follow Jigga\nHov's a living legend and I'll tell you why\nEverybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive90Embed"

Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\nEver, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?\n\nClose your eyes and imagine, feel the magic\nVegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses\nAnd I've realized that I've arrived\n'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe\n\"Does he write his own rhymes?\" Well, sort of, I think 'em\nThat mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of\n\"Damn, is he really that caught up?\"\nI ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?\nI remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort\nOr even a four-track recorder\nSo it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche\nSpoil yourself, that's important\nIf your stripper name \"Porsche\" and you get tips from many men\nThen your fat friend, her nickname is \"Minivan\"\nExcuse me, that's just the Henny, man\nI smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because\u2014\nYou might also like\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme\nForever ever?

The international asshole\nWho complain about what he is owed?\nAnd throw a tantrum like he is three years old\nYou gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul\nAnd wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame\nWhen he came in the game, he made his own lane\nNow all I need is y'all to pronounce my name\nIt's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say \"Kayne\"\nGot family in the D, kinfolk from Motown\nBack in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town\nLife movin' too fast, I need to slow down\nGirl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down\nMy father been said I need Jesus\nSo he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar\nThe preacher said we need leaders\nRight then, my body got still like a paraplegic\nYou know who you call; you got a message, then leave it\nThe Roc stand tall and you would never believe it\nTake your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic\nYeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic\nAfter debris settles and the dust get swept off\nBig K pick up where young Hov left off\nRight when magazines wrote Kanye West off\nI dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of\nA&R's lookin' like, \"Pssh, we messed up.\"\nGrammy night, damn right, we got dressed up\nBottle after bottle 'til we got messed up\nIn the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up\nPeople askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back\nThat'll be the same day I give the game back\nYou know the next question, dog: \"Yo, where Dame at?\"\nThis track the Indian dance to bring our reign back\n\"What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?\"\nThey pray for the death of our dynasty like \"Amen\"\nBut r-r-r-right here stands a man\nWith the power to make a diamond with his bare hands\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme\nForever ever?

Huh? 'Cause it's cultural?\nOr how about I'ma shoot you? Or fuck your bitch?\nOr how about all this Gucci, 'cause I'm fuckin' rich?\nYou'll deal with God for the lack of respect\nStartin' to make it seem like Donnie cut you a check\nNow you toyin' with hot lava, better be careful with that\nWhat's it mean to gain the world if you ain't standin' for shit?\nOkay I gotta say it, Ye, you sound high as a bigot\nYeah, genocide and slavery, we should just try and forget\nAnd all that free thought shit, find a better defense\nBut if Ye just stuck in his way, he can leave it at that\nFuck it\nYou might also like\nAlright, Tip, we could be rappin' about this all day, man\nWhy don't we just cut the beat off and let the people talk?60Embed"

Groupies say I'm too choosy\nTake 'em to the show and talk all through the movies\nSay she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays\nIf we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!\n\nGone\nWe striving home\nGone\nI ride on chrome\n\nY'all don't want no prob' from me\nWhat you rappers could get is a job from me\nMaybe you could be my intern, and in turn\nI'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter\nAaron love the raw dog, when will he learn\nCaught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn\nPlus, he already got three chil'r'n\nArguin' over babysitters like, \"Bitch, it's your turn\"\n\"Damn, Ye, it'd be stupid to diss you\nEven your superficial raps is super-official\"\nR-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on\nWith TVs in the ride, throw a movie on\nSaid he couldn't rap, now he at the top where dude belong\n'Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone\nYou might also like\nWe striving home, gone\nI ride on chrome, gone\nWe striving home\nWe striving home, gone (Killa)\nI ride on chrome\n\nKnock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?\nKilla Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla troop\nOh, my chinchilla blue, blue, you ever dealt with a dealer\nWell, here's the deal, ma, we going to the dealer, woo\nNo concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof\nAct up, get out, I don't need you, poof!\nPoof, be gone, damn, tough luck, dag (Dag)\nNiggas still doing puff-puff-pass (Puff, pass)\nPull the truck up fast and I tell 'em\nHey, back in a touched-up Jag, shit\nY'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum\nAn old man just gon' tell 'em too late\nThen I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone\nMy last girl want me back then I'm on\nFine, stay, you got the grind, hey\nCame back, read what the sign say (Too late, he's gone)\nYes, I know you wanna see my demise\nYeah, you church, boy, acting like a thief in disguise\nAin't even my size, see the greed in my eyes\nAsk Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, chyeah\nAnd that ain't even a lie, please believe me\nGave Weezie a piece of the pie and\nYou can ask George or Regina\nThe whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now\nWe striving home\nI ride on chrome\nListen, homeboy, move on\nThat's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?\n\nI been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone\nAnd trying to help his mama with the fact that her child gone\nAnd since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon\nGuess it's only right that I should help her from now on\nBut since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong\nNow they asking \"Cons, how long has this gone on?\"\nAnd maybe all this money might have gone to my head\n'Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds\nSo I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed\nAnd when I came the next morning, he was gone with my bread\nAnd with that being said, I had gone on my instincts\nAnd goin' to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks\nBut looking back now, I should've gone to the crib\nAnd rented Gone With the Wind, 'cause I'da gone in by ten\nBut I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar\nAnd heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car\nAnd now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far\nAnd now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars\nAnd since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes\nI guess I gone to the well one too many times, 'cause I'm gone\nUh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn\nUh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh\n\nI'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out\nSo the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out\nAnd that make me wanna get my advance out\nAnd move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house\nYeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind\nKanye step away from the lime\nLight like when I was on the grind\nIn the 1-9-9-9\nBefore model chicks was bending over\nOr dealerships asked me \"Benz or Rover?\"\nMan, if I could just get one beat on Hova\nWe could get up off this cheap-ass sofa\nWhat the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?\nSell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role\nMy dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural\nFired a week later, the manager count the churros\nSometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'\nHow we out in Europe, spending Euros\nThey claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone\nI know I got it, I don't know what y'all on\nI'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs\nWon't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free\nBut if they ever flip sides like Anakin\nYou'll sell everything including the mannequin\nThey got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston\nHold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm\nShorties at the door 'cause they need more\nInspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs\nThey said, \"Sorry, Mr. West is gone\"83Embed"
