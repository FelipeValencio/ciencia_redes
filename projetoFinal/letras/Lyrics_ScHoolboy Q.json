Signed to Top Dawg Entertainment and Interscope Records, Hanley is a member of hip-hop supergroup Black Hippy, along with fellow West Coast rappers and label-mates Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and Kendrick Lamar.\n\nQ was born on October 26, 1986, in a military base in Germany.

for the bitches\nThree to get ready cause I feel I finally did it\nFour's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished\nTurn that mothafucka to a critic\nMan, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog\nI was hanging on them corners late\nPockets wasn't straight, bitch\nI ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?\nNigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga\nI know the world got more problems and it's much bigger\nBut I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest\nTo all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for\nTo all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets\nFuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak\nTo all my niggas first time stepping in the pen\nRead a book and exercise, keep your spirit in\nTo all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today\nTake our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say\nYou might also like\nStay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga\nReally think about it, could be worse my nigga\nDon't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga\nWe all blessed my nigga\nStay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga\nReally think about it, could be worse my nigga\nDon't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga\nWe all blessed my nigga, ah\n\nNow how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?\nYou see my nigga just lost his son\nWhile I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder\nKiss her on the head as I cry for a bit\nThinking of some bullshit to tell him\nLike \"It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight\"\nWell, fuck that shit\nWhatever you need, yo, I got it!\nWhether it's money or some weed or putting in work\nFuck it, then I'm riding\nYou know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around\nTold myself that after y'all moved\nThat I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules\n\"Fuck police\" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school\nBut anyway, keep the faith\nStay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh\nKeep playing ball, cuz\nIt's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya\nTell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed\nI'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed\nLive life, smoke trees\nSee how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son\nStay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga\nReally think about it, could be worse my nigga\nDon't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga\nWe all blessed my nigga\nStay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga\nReally think about it, could be worse my nigga\nDon't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga\nWe all blessed my nigga, ah\n\nAnd you ain't gotta shed no tear\nI'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here\nI ain't forgot those years\nI'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here\n\nLiving in a premature place, wait\nNever grow to see the pearly gates, break\nEvery time a bullet detonate, dates\nOf obituary carry crates\nOf a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya\nIn December you was finna pin another case\nOn your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe\nAs the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain\nEvery pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain\nRecognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again\nThat's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain\nOpen up another chapter in the book and read 'gain\nStory of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change\nEverybody ain't blessed, my nigga\nYes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga\nDon't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet\nAnything you imagine, you possess, my nigga\nYou reject these niggas that neglect your respect\nFor the progress of a baby step, my nigga\nStep-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip\nBack-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip\nBlast at anybody say that you can't flip\nThis crack into rap music every other zip is a track\nGet used to it, get it off quick\nCome back, give back to the city you've built\nThat's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog\nIt ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog\nIn a minute everybody gon' be winning\nPut a little faith in it then recognize that we all\nBlessed my nigga, blessed my nigga\nReally think about it, could be worse my

lost they grandson\nThank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed\nLost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils\nGood weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan\nCause one day this rappin' gon'

mind\nNiggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like\nLa-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do\nNow we 'bout to break the bank\nMoney be on my mind\nNiggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like\nLa-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do\nLa-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do\nLa-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do, niggas talkin' 'bout\nLa-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do\nLa-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do\nNow we 'bout to break the bank\n\nWhat you talkin' 'bout if it ain't 'bout the money?\nNeck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey\nRain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money\nOn Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy"

to your politics\nMight cop the Phantom, get ghost\nI can pay your bills with this coat\nNeed an extra band for this smoke\nI can see for miles with this scope, nigga\nGot an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer\nMisses Piggy, want a piggyback\nRock cremation, then called it crack\nI'mma keep on eating 'til my ankles fat\nSell that fix, throw it cross the map\nPush my penis in between her lap\nPut my

Last night it was a dream\nThis morning a fantasy back when the only fan I had was a fiend\n(Huhhuhhuh-huhhuh!)\nMeet me by the Acura, cause the cops like\nTo get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea\nBut it's cool, I've been catching on to they formula\nSee I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'\nThen rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo\nThe bad guy, never once been a ho's hero\nHe get zero, I said nada, bitch pass the 'cama (Uh, yeah)\n\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga? (I'm a product of a real nigga)\nLa-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)\nFuck with one of my real niggas\n(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga?\n(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga (My whole life I've been a real nigga)\nLa-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)\nFuck with one of my real niggas\n(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)\nHow'd it feel to be a real nigga?\nYou might also like\n\nI done jumped up off my ass\nHit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling\n2012 ain't really happen\nSo I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning\nHad roaches in my cereal\nMy uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him\nBut... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga\nBut... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)\nBut... Me Glock clock familia (Boom)\n\nFind a nigga realer than me, my socks stink (yeah)\nEat so much pussy that my mustache pink\nStrapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt, gangsta lean help\nHoodie on backwards, with the eyes cut out\nMy hate felt my .45 elder, poetry's deep\nI never fail ya, ScHoolboy bust flame\nOrange-yellow higher than Margielas, since a young nigga\nI admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal\nFrom his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout\nThink about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday\nHe still get a hit, whether jacking radios or sucking dick\nSell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips\nCause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much\nTo get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work\nUnless we rewind, and answer my church\nTimes getting harder, than my dick on a growth spurt\nAround the same time, all you niggas was on purp, my sober ass Was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck\nFreeze! Give me the keys, extra Fritos, chili and\nCheese! Threw some Baby Lucas in his eyes, before I\nLeave! The cops'll never get the lead, grandma taught me well\nAnd my uncle gun, was the accessory, 211 sipping, plus a robbery\nThis little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome\n\nI done jumped up off my ass\nHit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling\n2012 ain't really happen\nSo I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning\nHad roaches in my cereal\nMy uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him\nBut...

Me Glock clock familia (Boom)\n\nGrandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more\nShe always got me things, that we couldn't afford\nThe new Js and Tommy Hill in my drawers\nSega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war\nWe wasn't thinking of getting money then\nNor did I wonder why, my uncle done sold his Benz\nCause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down\nI also notice moms be locking doors, when he around\nBut anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us\nMy bike is missing, Grandma like to hide her check every month\nMy uncle's nuts, he used to give me whiskey to piss in cups\nKnocking on the door telling me to \"Hurry up!\", he in a rush\nI gave it to him, then got my ass whipped for doing it\nMoms used to tell me like, \"Nigga, know who you dealing with.\"\nThem was the good days 'til I was raised the older ways\nRat-Tone, my nigga's brother showed me my first K\nI was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back\nHe called us over like - HEY!\nYAWK, YAWK, YAWK, YAWK! We like -\"Daaaaaamn, nigga\"\nThen again - YAWK, YAWK! We like, \"Daaaaaamn, nigga!\"\nHearing him say \"Cuz'\", turned us to a faaaaaan, nigga!\nLater on he got locked, so now we're taking his fades\nContinue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page\nGangbanging was a ritual and Grandma would help\nShe should've never left her gun on the shelf\nThis little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome\n\nI done jumped up off my ass\nHit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling\n2012 ain't really happen\nSo I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning\nHad roaches in my cereal\nMy uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him\nBut...

covers\nThrough the streets, we learned colors\nHidin' from the reaper, tryna dodge the cage\nThe shit I've done to rhyme on this stage\nI went from king of the corner\nTo breaking down weed on my diploma\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\n\nPicture me rollin', oh\nStraight outta the ghetto to a deluxe apartment in the sky (Straight ballin' like a bitch)\nPicture me rollin', oh, yeah\nI used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high\nSo high\nI used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high (Straight ballin' like a bitch)\n(So high)\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\n(So high)\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nStraight ballin' like a bitch\nStraight ballin' like a bitch"

dark)\nA groovy nigga that's way too G\n(Tryna tell you baby!)\n\nHe might say cuz but he ain't fucking with cuz\nYea I'm Q, but you can call me Quincy\nIf you want or whatever baby, it's all love\nFuck all that rapping, let me talk to you\nBook you a ticket, so we can kick it\nMake an escape somewhere we'll be safe\nClose your purse, I got my Visa on me\nPick out whatever, it ain't shit but money, turn you to my honey\nTake off my Salvatore, wipe your nose for ya\nClimb a mountain in the snow for ya\nYou see these dummies always cut you lose\nBut so much that a G can do, hit the weed, have a drink or two\nI pay attention, I can listen too, you say he fucking who?\nFresh out the shower, let me smell your hair\nGarnier Fructis got my knees weak, let's cuddle in these sheets\nLet me hold you for a moment, it feels right, don't it?\nFrom a lost child to a woman\nEye contact and soft kisses, strong grip, she want a gangsta, on crip\nYou might also like\n(Strolling in the party)\nCause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me\nJust tryna give it to ya\n(Walking in the dark)\nA groovy nigga that's way too G\n(Tryna tell you baby!)\n\nA 5'3\" stallion\nDaddy was from Harlem, her momma was Italian\nI don't see the challenge\nOf having two girls, you just gotta keep the balance\nI told her light that candle\nI heard you do yoga, I'm tryna see examples\nYour ass is like a handle\nSee us on the front page, that'll be a scandal\nTake off this red shirt, then my flannel\nI need some head first, then I'mma fuck you in them sandals\nHit the coochie like a dime sack\nAin't those Gucci, didn't I buy that?\nClose your eyes, go and try that\nYou only live once and I know I got you soaking wet\nThirsty, is the liquor store open yet\nI need some Moet to pour it on yo ass like a paint\nBack shots leave the pussy shaking, this my open invitation\nIn the morning, make my toast with fresh orange juice and turkey bacon, bitch\nDom Kennedy\n(Strolling in the party)\nCause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me\nJust tryna give it to ya\n(Walking in the dark)\nA groovy nigga that's way too G\n(Tryna tell you baby!)\n\nUnderground Royal\nFlow over they heads, air duct\nUpper crust, toast bread\nTalk of the town, thinking you know everything 'bout\nA nigga cause them bitches talk loud in them beauty shop\nGossip before your man came get ya\nYouTube clips can't show it all\nCome and get down if you really wan' get up, baby doll\nAin't nobody 'round to judge, go on\nGet if off your chest, vent, come up out that dress, bitch\nShe ain't take offense\nProceeded to take hits of the pregame twist, smoke out, smash\nGrub a little bit, pass out, post-game events\nToo high to find the remote, fell asleep to a infomercial\nWoke up in her mouth, reruns of Full House, followed by some Urkel\nOG my strain, rarely do I blaze purple\nSome of them growers be in a rush fucking the game up\nYou gon' learn about all that stuff long as you hang around us\nGo on roll up\n(Strolling in the party)\nCause you never met or seen a nigga quite like me\nJust tryna give it to ya\n(Walking in the dark)\nA groovy nigga that's way too G\n(Tryna tell you

gangstas on my left\nEverybody wave your rag around and bang the set\n\nNigga finally on another page\nGlock forty or the gauge (fade)\nHit a nigga with a blade, lay down, blocka\nThen go around, blocka\nThen another, take cover, black zip covers\nPass the deacon speakin', say the briefing\nI know I left that nigga leaking\nI know I coulda let him slide\nBut shit I'd rather slide a nigga\nForty-five a nigga\nShots will dive inside a nigga\nClean and sanitize a nigga\nSmooth operator, Under-layer\nFast forward them shots and those who play us\nGot love for my haters\nAnd garcia Vegas\nI put a dub in that it keeps my mind free of mazes\nSee my rhymes still amazes\nAmazing ass nigga here to lick and pass nigga\nScheme ass on blast nigga\nYou say you doing bad, nigga what you lying for\nBetter get your chopper and then turn this bitch to Rambo\nMeanwhile\n\nI got a hundred mothafuckers and it's\ufeff cracking (crack)\nEverybody do know my situation was happening (happen)\nBitches on my right, gangstas on my left\nEverybody wave your rag around and bang the set\nI got a hundred mothafuckers and it's\ufeff cracking (crack)\nEverybody do know my situation was
