  "plain": "Joey Bada$$, born Jo-Vaughn Virginie Scott (b. January 20, 1995) is an American rapper, actor, and record producer hailing from Brooklyn, New York. Becoming known for his rugged 90\u2019s style, an invigorating outcome of his Brooklyn neighborhood and surroundings, Joey Bada$$ has been a staple in the hip-hop industry for maintaining an authentic, unique and versatile sound. Whereas other rappers may take fewer risks with formulaic projects, Joey never shies away from keeping his music raw and original.\n\nHe is a co-founder of the collective Pro Era, with whom he has released two mixtapes and toured the globe multiple times.\n\nJoey gained recognition after he released his debut mixtape, 1999, on June 12, 2012 to critical acclaim and recognition, followed by Rejex in September, and Summer Knights on July 1, 2013.\n\nHis debut studio album, B4.DA.$$, released on January 20, 2015 (his 20th birthday) through Pro Era Records / Cinematic Music Group, sold an impressive 56,000 units its opening week making it the #1 rap and #1 independent album in the country. The project henceforth received acclaim from his critics as well as his fans and is the catalyst that has placed Joey among Hip-Hop\u2019s elite, as the album has sold 148,000+ copies worldwide to date.\n\nAfter his debut album, Joey has spent the better part of 2015 touring; playing overseas festivals; creating original music for soundtracks, such as Southpaw, as well as a national tour in the US, all while establishing the first annual Steez Day Festival in New York City on July 7th, 2015.\n\nJoey\u2019s sophomore album, ALL-AMERIKKKAN BADA$$, was released on April 7, 2017, despite being leaked about a week earlier (which was due in part to an early physical press of the album). The project includes features from heavy-hitters such as ScHoolBoy Q, J. Cole and Styles P, as well as known collaborators Kirk Knight, Nyck Caution, Chronixx and Meechy Darko.\n\nIn an interview with XXL, Joey Badass stated that he was influenced by Nas, Tupac Shakur, Black Thought, MF DOOM, J Dilla, Andre 3000, Jay-Z and The Notorious B.I.G. He has received heavy comparison to late rapper Big L. He has also been compared to Nas during his Illmatic era."

   "lyrics": "137 ContributorsWaves Lyrics\nYeah, you remember back in the days\nWhen niggas used to rock waves and shit?\nWhen like, yo, I had the fucking 360s, my nigga\nLike nobody in the hood was fucking with my shit\nAnd that's real shit\n\nSince '95 momma been working nine-five\nAnd I know the landlord fed up with our lies\nSo we pray to the gods, the Jahs and the Allahs\nTo keep us safe and watch our lives\n'Cause all we tryna do is do good\nPut on my hood when I walk through hoods\n'Cause these niggas these days is loco\nYou'll get it in ya vocals if you ain't a local\nYeah, that's why I'm tryna go global\nYeah, that's why I'm tryna be a mogul\nAnd I'm hopeful that me spittin' it soulful\nWill have me in the Daily Postal, flying coastal, eatin' tofu\nLike I told you, I know niggas who trash rappin'\nWorried bout the trendin' fashions rather than ascendin' passion\nThey want me send 'em tracks but I just send 'em laughter\nRight after I start laughin', they start askin' \"What happened?\"\nBut back to the chapter\nMomma told me \"follow dreams\", should never have to ask her to\nSo that\u2019s what I do, became an MC master\nSince then it\u2019s been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper\nGo ahead, ask 'em \"Who is Joey Bad?\"\nWatch 'em gasp, asthma, damn, it\u2019s so sad\nHe paused the chatter 'cause he know he rather back up\nThan to admit the kid is hotter than magma\nBut fuck it, you gotta give credit where it's due\n'Cause you ain't gon' like the karma when it's set up on you\nIt can get you on your medical, fuck you up in the decimals\nOr get you 2 to 3 for residue found in your retinal\nUh, and they told me not to be so complex\nDumb it down to accomplish articles in Complex\nAnd The Source \u2014 alfredo, of course\nThere I go again, steppin' out of line, runnin' off course\nI heard reports that it's like sexual intercourse\nWith your thoughts when I talk about the shoes in which I walk\nFor it is not faux, nor false that this kid from the north\nSpeaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults\nI'm sure by now you can assume he never lost\nUnless with some form of divorce, or a corpse\nBorn boss, no days off, child labor\nLet me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes\nYeah\nYou might also like\nWhat, what the rap audience ain't ready for is a real person\nYou know what I wanna say: a real N-I-G-G-A\nI'm coming at 'em 100% real, I ain't compromising nathan'\nAnybody that talk about me got problems, you know what I'm sayin'?\nIt's gonna be straight-up, like if I was a street person\nThat's how I'm comin' at the whole world\nAnd I'm being real about it and I'ma grow with my music\n\nYeah, but it's far from over\nWon't stop 'til I meet Hova and my momma's in a Rover\n'Til I'm an owner of the world's finest motors\nI blow like supernovas in your daughter's room on a poster\nKnown as history's biggest musical composer\nNo disrespect to Bob Mar, but yeah, another stoner\nMarijuana my odor, and when I get older\nHope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum\nLike three times, have three kids\nI hope me and my wife can show 'em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did\nI hope they acknowledge the knowledge\n'Cause yeah, they gon' need it\n'Cause when my parents tried to tell me, I just wouldn't receive it\nCouldn't believe it, till I saw with my own pupils\nFelt bad when I learned that their advice was truly useful\nBut fuck it, only made us as human beings more mutual\nEven though over time, my punishments, they grew more crucial\nShould use the word brutal, 'cause my parents mad strict\nHope one day I'll attract the likes of even Madlib\nGo gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered\nUntil then, all I can do is imagine\nImagine, I'ma make it all happen\n(Yeah, that's my boy)93Embed\nYeah, you remember back in the days\nWhen niggas used to rock waves and shit?\nWhen like, yo, I had the fucking 360s, my nigga\nLike nobody in the hood was fucking with my

Nigga you ain't help me get it\nNow these niggas see me getting it, check the statements on my debit\nMy profile get requested but I never hit \"accept\"\nHit the sour to the chest, I reflect\nWhen I was 14, up late, eyes glued to the sampler screen\nEyes beam, 'cause we can make it better\nSmoking on that Jack Herer, welcome to the Progressive Era\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\n'Cause I deserve my respect\nAnd brains don't matter but tell me what really matters\nWhen you pissed off at the world like you got a crazy bladder\nAnd, momma always said that shit don't come on silver platters\nSo I gather my thoughts and make use of all these synonyms\n'Cause I could never swallow the truth, like it's cinnamon\nExcuse me if I'm militant\nThe sinning men in my hood could leave a nigga quivering\nLike goddamn, deliver him, the venom in his liver is\nCorrupting all his ligaments\nNow he's at a standstill so tell me if he'll live again\nThe fire in his heart, still seem to be simmering\nNow take that little simmer and turn it into adrenaline\nPenicillin could not stop the drive he be giving 'em like mad fours\nBut fast forward, let's get to the part where his records\nCould 'fford him a couple Fords like \"Lord, ain't he gifted?\"\nChristmas just doesn't fit him, I need my own holiday\nAnd by the way, I'ma possibly own Monopoly\nAnd all McDonald's property 'cause I won't live in poverty like\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\nIn the clouds come and find me, someone flier than Hermione\nHomie tripping, got 'em sounding like Hansen in the '90s\nCharlie Manson your whole body, cause that damage in your party\nCan you manage what I'm dishing out? Go get your wishing count\nYou sell me something then I flip that amount\nI just switched that account, get that profit then I'm out\nYeah, they all wonder but it's Nyck bitch don't doubt\nRip your lips off your mouth\nMan I'm violent ring the siren with these bars I'm reciting\nCars with no license\nHard man, I'm feeling like a spartan with a trident\nDamn, picture perfect, bet I'll make that picture worth it\nI'll be doubling my spot, no Louisiana Purchase\nSo declare that, with my hair back\nYou want a fair one, catch a fair smack\nI hunt up on my prey\nSo pray I ain't hunting on your ass today like be afraid\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nCause I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\nCool cuts flow, the deli can't touch this\nSlipping like fishes, choking when you hit the cypher\nAnd I ain't talking weed smoke but I let the weed blow\nAnything, just let the leaves know, oh\nSuckas fuck around, get clapped where you rest at\nNigga saying you cracking, fabric of your imagination\nAsk your lady\nIt's assassin when I come up on the track\nIt's a curse that I always try to find sex in these verses\nBut I got your attention, it's part of my ascension\nBut if I keep toking this strain\nIt's gonna leave me stranded in this dimension\nOr to mention, niggas is snitching\nMight charge me with battery\nBut fuck that, 'cause piss was never in your anatomy\nSo don't try to lie on a nigga that got mine on my third eye shit\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nI tell you I

how my wheels keep on spinning\nAnd they see we getting love cause they see the Pros is winning\n'Cause we giving love back so they peeping how we fitting\nAin't gonna have no sus' nigga stepping to me\nI like to keep my chakras open so respect my G\nI got the bush going in, repping FBT\nSo sus' niggas watch your back, Pros next to me\nI got Chuck on the team to collect the green\nAnd show these suspect niggas what it mean to scheme\nAnother apex predator crushing your dreams\nGonna get your wig pushed back between my cream\nTaking all you sus' niggas, throw you out the scene\nI'm taking all you sus' niggas, throwin' out the scene\nTaking all you sus' niggas, throw you out the scene\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\nThe P, the R, the O, the Dette\nNever am I vexed, I'm always calm, cool, collect\nUnless you disrespect, I wreck you verbally\nSo expect the worst from me, I beck you with my intellect\nYou best be circumspect check, made you making all the wrong moves\nDo I intimidate you, or more infuriate you?\n'Cause I annihilate all who participating for the gore\nLovers I decapitate with everything I say, see\nCome sneak a peak and, tell me what you peeping\nThen struggle to say it ain't greatness that you seeing\nIt is what here sits in the midst of us, yeah it's quite mysterious\nNo you're not delirious, I'm serious, it's clear to us\nAdd some crystals, gonna see gold\nThen platinum, seen it on some tarots before\nSo I know how it is all gonna go down\nGotta go more uptown, more in the cloud\nCause didn't ya know by now, I'm skyline bound\nAnd my time's now, I don't graze ground, I'm new in your town\nSo assume what you please but you don't know me\nSay what you please but you don't know T'nah\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n\nWho that mofo that came to showboat just 'cause he float like no other?\nStyle smooth as butter and slick like lubricant rubbers\nSo going in on tracks ain't a real test, the real quest\nIs making real tracks with feelings people ain't feel yet\nDessy be that suspect for subjects for all the records\nSet in for all the records, I spit in a split of seconds\nSo you can't reckon that I wasn't checking for beats unpleasant\nI eat up a track and hit your producer up for seconds\nRemember I'm the face, so lace me in the line-up\nThe bars that I could line up could probably bump the fine up\nDefine what never can judge, rap is in my blood\nSo much, my capillaries adapted a sanctuary\nFrom the fifth of January, every punchline turned into crunch time\nWas cutting records more times than my school's lunch line\nSo if this hits mine, go ahead and pop your wrist fine\nBeen spitting dirty, the vocals recording spit shine\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nAnd I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye shit\n'Til the day I die, I'll be puffing lye, fuck the world, fuck it dry\nTell them government spies I won't cover my eyes\nWon't cower, won't move 'cause I don't move like a coward\nKnowledge is power and the flower of life is ours\nGet as high as ours, maybe you could see the towers\nScour your dirty mind and maybe you unleash the power\nWe all got the potential in our body and soul, probably you know\nI found mines right through the pencil, started bodying flows\nBut fuck that, this be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval\nI hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to squeal\nThis one for my people, headed to the top, no redo\nThinking up evil but see no evil, just be Knievel\nCause I ain't ask to be this good, they just made me better\nThey told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar\nAnd the green only made me clever\nSee God made three Bigs, two Pacs, but he only made one error\nThe Era\n\nSuspect niggas don't come outside\nYou might get your wig pushed back tonight\nSaid I deserve my respect\nBrains don't matter if your wig get split on some third eye

tube\nThey like \"Yo Joey, you rude\", I'm like \"If only you knew\nI'm only in school for cosmology, that's why I act as lonely as you\"\nYou see, I'm wise beyond my years and my peers\nSo my voice over the snares is the only way they hear\nWhat I got behind my membrane, but I've been smoking chem strains\nSo lately I've been having hard times with remembering\nBut be patient, my studies prove Egyptians ain't shit\n'Cause I believe that we could be like Neo in \"The Matrix\"\nBut fuck it, I'm erratic, momma lock me in the attic please\nTil I draw enough static in my somatic anatomy\nAnd come out imputed with fusions of \"Blueprints\" and \"Illmatics\"\nI've been going raw, this just how I feel rappin'\nWe gave y'all Sur' Tactics, so y'all can't even gas us\nWe taught you how to be prepared but still attacking the masses\nY'all better get y'all caskets 'cause we 'bout to annihilate\n(The new Babylon era) My empire gate's in the Empire State\nI'm on the higher platform, look at the way they clap for 'em\nNever fuck with phony men 'cause I don't like my back torn\nNigga, ask Kwon, this that top ramen' you ain't used to\nKeep it neutral to scruple and tell 'em no beef like

prime\nAs-Salaam-Alaikum, alaikum salaam\nPeace to my Slimes, and peace to my Crips\nNeighborhood police and they always on the shift\nProtect my Bloods, look out for my cuz\nWhen it's all said and done, we be the realest there was\nWho else if just not us?\nIf you 'bout this revolution, please stand up\nWe ain't got no one to trust\nTime is running up, feel the burn in my gut\nAnd if you got the guts, scream, \"Fuck Donald Trump\"\nWe don't give a fuck, never had one to give\nNever will forget, probably never will forgive\nUh, I guess that\u2019s just how it is\nAnd they still won't let the Black man live\n\nFeel the energy surge through my veins when I flow\nMentally, I can never be controlled\nNo sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed\nWill they remember me when I'm gone?\nI say rockabye, rockabye, rockabye baby\nShotta boy, shotta boy, shotta go crazy\nMe nuh play games, so please don't play me\nLook at what they made me\nYou might also like\nI'm part of the reason they still Crippin' out in Brooklyn\nBefore I was an artist I would book 'em, mm\nPush ya shit back while on them front line, nigga, ya lunch time\nI'm by them stop sign, you love that wi-fi\nOn mamas for them dirty dollars, brains on collars\nPark the car around the corner, I'll be there in a second\nThe murder weapon on me, fuck if this bitch start flamin'\nThe cops patrollin', get that punk ass American flag ceremony\nAww, damn am I going too far?\nGive you some flavor to borrow\nBitch yeah it came with the car\nIt's off-white, leveled the hard\nYou ball, might come with a charge\nYour kids don't know you no more\nYour girl's draws stay on the floor\nNo phone call accepted in weeks\nYour son picked up on your beef, real shit\nFrom gettin' lynched in field into ownin' buildings\nGetting millions, influencin' white children\nAnd oddly we still ain't even\nStill a small percentage of blacks that's eating\nSame routines, the same dope fiends\nThem nightmare dreams, forever murder season\nBad intentions to them picket fences\nThey gave us guns but won't hire us, nigga?\nSo we killin' senseless\nHomies murked on the bus benches\nRetaliation 'cause his mama cryin'\nKept it gangsta 'til I modify 'em\nRockabye, rockabye\nFeel the energy surge through my veins when I flow\nMentally, I can never be controlled\nNo sympathy for foes, my enemies exposed\nWill they remember me

the herbs\u2014check\n\nMy man Dirty had the buddha just to put me in my right mind\nI rhyme stoned, drop jewels and bright lines\nSight dimes wit' slight closed eyes, I'm slight sober\nMa, you ain't that girl at giving throat, so bye\nF it, I'm bipolar, took shorty to the backroom\nPlay charades, she actin' like a vacuum\nShowed her to the door before the afternoon\nShe fell hard on the floor, so you know that she'll be back soon\nFake MC's get their reps ruined\nYoung villain hop up on the track then the track doomed\nClick-clack-boom, resurrecting boom-bap from the tombs\nRaps dope like crack in cocoons\nBack in this mood, back on the move\nIt's the motherfucking real, nigga, chill, act cool\nPay respect to the cat Drew\nAnd I'm way too blessed to be throwing shots at you\nYou might also like\nBi\u2014Bi\u2014Bi\u2014Big, big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest (Uh, yeah)\nBi\u2014Bi\u2014Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the era (Uh)\n\nI'm tryna find my own lane, in this freeway of life\nJust remember home boy there ain't no free way to life\nMy nigga, it's gon' cost you, try not to lose your soul\nTo the rims, hoes, and gold\n'Cause once the devil grab hold, that nigga ain't letting go\nAnd I'm far from religious, I just know right and wrong\nI know how to write these songs, I know how to light these bongs\nI know how to rip thongs and I'm pretty good at beer pong\nNigga, I'm so crazy, nigga, I'm loco\nGassed up like Sunoco, press the pedal through the floor\nBitch, we out the door, vroom vroom, skrrt\nBitch, love don't live here no more\n'Cause her weave look faker than her Louie bag\nWeak chick I tried to bag, had the nerve to turn me down\nHeard this song and turned around, now she want me to unzip her pants\nBut I'm gone, bitch missed her chance\n\nBi\u2014Bi\u2014Bi\u2014Big, big ups to Brooklyn, home of the realest\nBi\u2014Bi\u2014Big ups to Brooklyn, home of the era\nBig, Big,Bi\u2014Big, big ups to Brooklyn, home of the

like bust acid\nPuff, assist like Maravich, a true Maverick\nAnd I average above average on an average day\nDoing bad shit, bet you still can't pass this\nAnd his teacher still pass him\nThough they adolescents be addin' rappin' sessions over addin' lessons\nLike fuck trigonometry, I'm trying to multiply monopolies\nSubtract some homies then divide the cheese\nDivide legs just to isosceles so my eyes can see through the E\nShit on your hypotheses\nHypocrisy after essence like apostrophes\nYou can't stand here unless you pay a posture fee\nPart the cheese, head out the spot and leave\nA pile of G's for apology\n\nJoey Bad and Chuck Strangers\nLe\u2014Le\u2014Leaving niggas endangered\nDa\u2014Da\u2014Danger, da\u2014da\u2014danger, da\u2014da\u2014\nJoey Bad leaving niggas

My brothers under a spell\nIt's clear we livin' in hell, the life of a black male\nRight out the womb, you come out, and it's a bunch of blackmail\nJust waitin' for you to fail, a special room in the jail\nWith your name, a number on it so you property now\nI see it properly now, it's what the poverty 'bout\nIt's all a game of Monopoly, tryna cop me a house\nAn elephant in the room until I fit in my tomb\nAnd introduced to my doom, they say the end comin' soon\n\nLegends, they never die\nThe niggas only multiply\nSo put your fire up in the sky\n'Cause they won't ever kill the light\nThey say the legends, they never die\nThe niggas only multiply\nSo put your fire up in the sky\n'Cause they won't ever kill the light\n\nTables keep turning, which way do I go?\nA fire's burning inside of my soul\nTables keep turning, which way do I go?\nA fire's burning inside my control\n\nLook, ready for whatever comes\nI hope for the best, I taste the peace and pray it never leave my tongue\nBut yet, before long, the feelings done\nPerhaps I was foolish, just like the boy that prays to only see the sun\nMaybe, life happens like tides\nOne minute you're low and feelin' shallow, then all of a sudden you rise\nJust, ride the wave, I say to myself\nFind a way, the weight of my wealth\nIt's honestly a lot to bear\nI play the game of stackin' knowin' that I ought to share\nHow much does a man need? How much can he hoard before his greed?\nHow can a rich father teach humbleness to his seed?\nJust questions, the stubborn all get taught tough lessons\nI look at all I got like, \"What's missin'?\"\nGod is my only guess, 'cause yes, faith relieve the stress\nI find peace again when I find Him and see I'm blessed\nReal blessed, life has always got me wonderin'\n(Wondering, wondering) Am I doin' it right?\nAm I hurtin' myself?\nAm I wrongin' the ones that love me the most?\nWhat a burden to have\nThat ain't no way to live\nOr maybe it is\nWell, maybe it is\n\nTables keep turning, which way do I go?\nA fire's burning inside of my soul\nTables keep turning, which way do I go?\nA fire's burning inside my control\n\nLegends, they never die\nThe niggas only multiply\nSo put your fire up in sky\n'Cause they won't ever kill the light\nThey say the legends, they never die\nThe niggas only multiply\nSo put your fire up in sky\n'Cause they won't ever kill the light\n\nThis is legendary, it's never secondary\nI'm getting better every January\nThe idea of it alone is very scary\nI kill my enemies by any means necessary\nI said, this is legendary, it's never secondary\nGetting better every January\nThe idea of it alone is very scary\nI kill my enemies by any means necessary"

just like my first love\nStay humble, but I knew that I was first up\nPicked up the pen, and that's when I drew my first blood\nSpill my heart again, 'cause the pain'll never end\nHappiness is temporary, always has been\nI just lost one, but sometimes, I win\nI always spread love, but sometimes I sin\nI only trust some, that's why I keep a few friends\nFunny 'cause I used to see my circle never end\nAlways kept like 47 friends in my circumference\nAll that's left now is the radius\nThey still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere\nThings get severe for everybody, everywhere\nThis is my moment of truth, right here\nSwear I ain't scared of no man, I see the omens\nI pick 'em up and keep it rollin'\nThe omnipresence is omnipotent\nBut I keep going, 'til it's all said and done\nI show all my soul purpose, but I'm pretty sure there's one\nThere's a reason why I've come, new season's just begun\nThis the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son\nYou might also like\nSo don't mourn me when I'm gone, celebrate my travels\nWhenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones\nI'm headed home, I've been hurting too long\nTime don't stand still, so you gotta move on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, yeah\n\nI had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone\nAnd read: \"Here lies a G,\" followed by a poem (Oh, oh)\nI couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own\nFunny that I write most when I know my feeling wrong\nWent with both shoulders that my head is always on\nI charged through harm's way, carried boulders on my arms (My arms)\nI feel strong as I walk through the many storms (Many storms)\nThat rain on my parade, seen the doves cry for days\nI'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today\nMy name ring bells all the way to heaven's gates\nThough Steezy told about me, yo, I know he always watching\nI guess there really is a heaven for us hip-hoppers\nI really miss my partner\nBut I know he with Big Poppa, 2Pacs, and a big L, rolled proper\nAnd that's a big pun\nKnow that I'ma join him when my time come\nBut the story just begun\nSo don't mourn me when I'm gone, celebrate my travels\nWhenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones\nI'm headed home, I've been hurting too long\nTime don't stand still, so you gotta move on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, yeah\n\nOne day, I'ma fly away\nOne day, I'ma fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nOne day, you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nOne day, we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nLet's just go...\nMy clouds gray, I hope my pain don't show (No)\nLooking in the sky, I wonder where them rainbows go (Oh)\nThey say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold's will show (Show)\nEven skating down the block don't feel the same no more (No more)\nIf I ain't looking, I still see it all\nMy vision's jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls\nThey stay scheming, y'all like the sheep to the shepherd\nThe trees to the leaves, you needed but not needed (Mm, mm)\nSo I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping\nI'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating\nI'm not eating, not blaming, I'm just saying\nGo to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking\nThey too fake\nNo rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break\nBreak a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank\nBreak a hundred, that's fifty-fifty\nLong as Rawle and Whitney seen different cities, different titties\nAll with no money with me\nI'm on my grind, man, no regrets when I die, man\n'Til we fly, man, 'til we fly, man, 'til we fly, man\nYou gon' miss us when we fly, man\nSo don't mourn me when I'm gone, celebrate my travels\nWhenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones\nI'm headed home, I've been hurting too long\nTime don't stand still, so you gotta move on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, yeah\n\nOne day, I'ma fly away\nOne day, I'ma fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nOne day, you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nOne day, we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)66Embed\nYeah, momma I just booked a first-class ticket\nTo my destiny, by the way, yeah\n\nMaybe I'ma fly away\nMaybe I'ma fly away, some day\n\nYeah, so gullible just like my first love\nStay humble, but I knew that I was first up\nPicked up the pen, and that's when I drew my first blood\nSpill my heart again, 'cause the pain'll never end\nHappiness is temporary, always has been\nI just lost one, but sometimes, I win\nI always spread love, but sometimes I sin\nI only trust some, that's why I keep a few friends\nFunny 'cause I used to see my circle never end\nAlways kept like 47 friends in my circumference\nAll that's left now is the radius\nThey still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere\nThings get severe for everybody, everywhere\nThis is my moment of truth, right here\nSwear I ain't scared of no man, I see the omens\nI pick 'em up and keep it rollin'\nThe omnipresence is omnipotent\nBut I keep going, 'til it's all said and done\nI show all my soul purpose, but I'm pretty sure there's one\nThere's a reason why I've come, new season's just begun\nThis the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son\n\nSo don't mourn me when I'm gone, celebrate my travels\nWhenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones\nI'm headed home, I've been hurting too long\nTime don't stand still, so you gotta move on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, yeah\n\nI had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone\nAnd read: \"Here lies a G,\" followed by a poem (Oh, oh)\nI couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own\nFunny that I write most when I know my feeling wrong\nWent with both shoulders that my head is always on\nI charged through harm's way, carried boulders on my arms (My arms)\nI feel strong as I walk through the many storms (Many storms)\nThat rain on my parade, seen the doves cry for days\nI'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today\nMy name ring bells all the way to heaven's gates\nThough Steezy told about me, yo, I know he always watching\nI guess there really is a heaven for us hip-hoppers\nI really miss my partner\nBut I know he with Big Poppa, 2Pacs, and a big L, rolled proper\nAnd that's a big pun\nKnow that I'ma join him when my time come\nBut the story just begun\n\nSo don't mourn me when I'm gone, celebrate my travels\nWhenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones\nI'm headed home, I've been hurting too long\nTime don't stand still, so you gotta move on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, yeah\n\nOne day, I'ma fly away\nOne day, I'ma fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nOne day, you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nOne day, we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nLet's just go...\nMy clouds gray, I hope my pain don't show (No)\nLooking in the sky, I wonder where them rainbows go (Oh)\nThey say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold's will show (Show)\nEven skating down the block don't feel the same no more (No more)\nIf I ain't looking, I still see it all\nMy vision's jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls\nThey stay scheming, y'all like the sheep to the shepherd\nThe trees to the leaves, you needed but not needed (Mm, mm)\nSo I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping\nI'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating\nI'm not eating, not blaming, I'm just saying\nGo to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking\nThey too fake\nNo rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break\nBreak a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank\nBreak a hundred, that's fifty-fifty\nLong as Rawle and Whitney seen different cities, different titties\nAll with no money with me\nI'm on my grind, man, no regrets when I die, man\n'Til we fly, man, 'til we fly, man, 'til we fly, man\nYou gon' miss us when we fly, man\n\nSo don't mourn me when I'm gone, celebrate my travels\nWhenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones\nI'm headed home, I've been hurting too long\nTime don't stand still, so you gotta move on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, and on and on, and on and on\nAnd on, yeah\n\nOne day, I'ma fly away\nOne day, I'ma fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nOne day, you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)\nOne day, we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)"

money\nHoneys used to run from me when pockets was dust bunnies\nNow what's funny is we done came up and conquered\nEven the future lookin' bonkers from Compton to Yonkers\nThough them gangstas grill, I tell 'em keep that drama away\nDon't fuck with thieves, I like Jay so who sponsorin' the tape\nThey launchin' out strays, I'm tryin' not to get sprayed\nWhether a spitter or a quitter behind the trigger, approaching his prey\nHis eyes bigger, won't stop to consider\nWhat's right or wrong, because it's hard liquor that's inside his liver\n\nBut that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends\nWhether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams\nBetter choose the right scheme\nCause you could think you're cool with your nice things\nBut get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam\nBut that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends\nWhether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams\nBetter choose the right scheme\nCause you could think you're cool with your nice things\nBut get wiped clean for ice creams when the lights beam\nYou might also like\nTraded in my Nikes for a new mic\nI guess it's safe to say he sold soul for his new life\nLike they were tryna blind us, but we know the true designer\nThey didn't wanna see us find the diviners\nSo now we hit the vines up day and night\nOn the regular, I know my momma prayin' like\nShe want me reach my aims in life, but just stay in sight\nSo I'm shootin' for my dreams, hit the booth and it boost my esteem\nThe Pro Era crew recruitin' in them fiends by the boat load\nNigga caught a wave and now he surfin' coastal\nThey don't feel the name but they say the music dope though\nFuck it, that's how it's supposed to go, these bloggers too emotional\nThey'll be postin' you until labels start interscopin' you\nBy then, it's wild late and I'll be chillin' where I lay\nCause I'd rather see the top than to be livin' where I lay\nImbalances in my Kundalini, they tryna put two through my beanie\nWish you well, tryin' to poof a genie\n\nBut that's just daily routine, the streets are cooped fiends\nWhether the hoops or the booth, niggas shoot dreams\nBetter choose the right

had to burn (Check)\n\nIt all started with this special herb, then after that, it came to sexual words\nI'm meeting shorty up to patch her a verse\nShe played Bonnie and I collide with a vibe when I'm inside her walls\nI cut my shorties on the side cause I decide that she all\nMine's, I keep her in my eyes at all times\nNot because I don't trust her I just, can't get enough of her\nOn the phone late until her mom dukes be cussing her\nShe played the hustler and I'm like mad customers\nMan swear I'm in love and ain't afraid to admit it\nBe blowing up her line, man I swear I'm addicted\nBut, it's all cool cause when in love, we all fools\nThey say men lie and women lie naked, that's all foolin'\nNumbers don't matter after the first night\nRight, so what the fuck is love at its first sight\nIf you ask me, another stupid analogy\nMade to cover flaws in the female anatomy\nYou might also like\nBut I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches\nDon't front (Don't front) don't front (Don't front)\nDon't front, don't front though (Don't, don't, don't front)\nI got some weed and some fronto (Don't front)\nAnd you know I always hunt hoes\nI tell 'em leave but don't walk through the front door\nNow don't front (Don't front) don't front (Don't front)\nCheck (Don't, don't, don't front)\n\nIt's like a massacre when mass occur\nI got a massive urge but I had to learn\nHeard you had it on lock so I pass the word\nI stash the herb, sit back observe\nThat she make me feel good is all I ask of her\nIn the clouds, who would've known we would've crash and burn?\nI prayed long and hard, hoping things will last with her\nI ain't mad at her, but I really wish that it ain't have to hurt\nLet's be blunt, we're best buds\nBoth knew our role this is more than just a crush\nI used to pick her up longing for our lips to touch\nBut now I rarely even see her\nIn everybody, hood not even the law enforcement can keep up\nShe ain't want no one to know, so I kept it on the low\nAny time that we would kick it, I make sure I had some toe\nI thought I knew her better than anyone would know\nBagged her at her friends, but home were I would take her\nDidn't know that she was a ho, that only wanted my paper\nWhenever I was with her, my mind would just relax\nCould've been the hot topic cause I swore we were a match and\nI admit it girl you fine as hell\nDon't know your perfume but you exert the finest smells\nYou tryna find her then follow her trail\nShe left a few old lovers inside of a jail, that's all a part of the tale\nBut I'ma keep gradually telling these bitches\nDon't

leave but don't walk through the front door\nNow don't front (Don't front) don't front (Don't front)\nCheck (Don't, don't, don't front)\n\nAyo, don't tell me be patient with no doctor prescription\nEmotionless positions and provocative visions\nShould've known you missed a note like the octave was switching\nRemember hate the game but she's spotting some glitches\nIt's a simulation yeah, stimulation\nTake off your shirt, let me feel manipulative\nMy heart like the Himalayas, but yeah, I gotta slay her\nI'm crushing on you sweetheart but yeah I'm a player\nSort of like Isaiah so baby let me coach you\nAnd I know I'm not the first jerk to approach you\nSo, this ain't nothing new to you, nothing unusual\nNothing you ain't used to so my nothing is useable\n\nWe all try when you go bye, we all high\nTruth is I'm never home and I'm cold if that's where the heart lies\nSo label me as heartless, it's not that I don't care\nI just learned to use my heart less, gain sanity and lost stress\nIt put me in a state that just started taking a toll on me\nKept the secrets you told me, keep emotions I would hold beneath\nAlways kept the L so I know defeat\nSaid everything will feel much better soon as you know I leave\nNot sure if it's the meds that made you think I'm mediocre\nI was still body with a glove on, you know I'm cold, ma\nI'm in animal pause, but you got an Ark\nWhen it flooded, used to always feel like Noah\nAnd I know I know her, had these kind of skills I had to show her\nSo I told her I'm the nigga she see on the posters\nCame back through and I put it in the holster\nJust had to teach her one time\n\nPut it down, don't really give a fuck though (Don't front)\nAnd tell your bitch don't front though (Don't front)\nDon't front (Front, front, front,

In fact I plan it all\nFuck what the media write, bitch this is a fire bar\nPlease don't leave your comment if you are not up to par\nNo names, putting you in a verse that's too far\nYou're mundane can't obtain, the knowledge in my brain\nMy set told me light you up so this that propane\nIt's Nathan all I gotta do is just spit a flame\nNo escaping, you in a swimming pool of champagne\nYou set yourself up for that one mane. The king of New York?\nHa! we ain't just gon' let that one hang\nLast nigga got dethroned and you ain't from my zone\nThe rest of the real niggas is dead and gone\n\nBut fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun\nI\u2019m God\u2019s Son, I\u2019m Pac, Guru all in one\nI'm what they predicted before I come\nIn fact I do it all for them\nBut fuck it I'm Biggie, I'm L, I'm Pun\nI\u2019m God\u2019s Son, I\u2019m Pac, Guru all in one\nI'm what they predicted before I come\nIn fact I do it all for them\nYou might also like\nI'm getting a ugh, I'm getting a ugh from the weak shit\nThat I hear, no lyrical style come near me\nHow they gon' try to compare me to what's clearly\nBarely, not nearly as rare as me\nSwank make hands fold like a rare disease\n\"How thou art write this?

my rifle\nI'm aimin' at my rival, sure to leave him dead on arrival\nThey say it's all about survival, never lackin' the vitals\nSo I came to kill the game and still gave it revival\nI'm coming for the title, man it's best you throw in the towel\nLast nigga who tried to vio, now facin' a trial\nI'ma be here for a while, gettin' richie like Lionel\nNow she all up in denial 'cause she gettin' the dial\nWhile I'm only gettin' better, so she back on my D now\nI wanna be down but she denounced\nI got my shot, then made her, bounce\nNow you tryna rebound, I'm livin' in the now\nWhile the future figure me out\nTold mommy pick a place, yo, and we out\n'Cause Bed Stuy a little unsafe for me now\nThat's why I keep the .40 loaded with no safety around\nNever thought I'd have to hold it, I'm just holdin' it down\nProtect my neck and my crown, patrol throughout the town\nAnd they judgin' just 'cause my skin color is brown\nAnd for that, they wanna leave me dead in the ground\nAnd have the nerve to blame it all on my background\nSorry white Amerikkka, but I'm about to black out\nGot a message for the world and I won't back out\nSo turn the kid raps loud, I'm about to spazz out\nWatch out, another nigga runnin' in the White House\nBut I won't stop 'til this whole shit painted in all black\nAnd we on top, 'cause my people been paining before crack\nMedia's got this whole thing tainted, that's all fact\nFeedin' you lies like this whole thing wasn't built on our backs\nAssimilate our history then made it a mystery\nNow they all inherit the bittersweet victory\nLook at what they did to me, can I get a witness please?\nJustice never served, reparations never sent to me\nIt's clear who the enemy, they declare war on the end of me\nAssassinate my character, buryin' my entity\nBut they can't kill my energy, so when it's said and done\nThey forever gon' remember me\nThe fuck is you tellin' me?\nFuck is you tellin' me?\nWay more than a celebrity\nAnd fuck white supremacy, huh\nYou might also like\nI'm out for dead presidents to represent me\nDead fuckin' presidents to represent me\nI'm out for dead presidents to represent me\nBecause I've never known a live one that represent me\nWell, dead presidents to represent me\nI'm out for dead presidents to represent me\nDead fuckin' presidents to represent me\nBecause I've never known a live one that represent me\nIt's no contest, can't fuck with the congress\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nIt's no contest, can't fuck with the congress\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nMe and my niggas goin' off like bomb threats\nMe and my niggas goin' off\n\nThis that Bada$$-assination\nTopic of conversation, my proclamation to the nation and its congregation\nBeen makin' observations like it's my occupation\nDebatin' speculation like it ain't just second nature\nThou shall love thy neighbor, don't let that nigga hate you\n'Cause he know where you lay up, when it's karma, time to pay up\nClimb the ladder of success, I'm steady on my way though\nDevisin' plans while you sleepin' I'm just tryna stay woke\nYou leave me no choice, I'm about to bring noise\nGot to fill this void, I got to be the voice\nYeah yeah yeah\nI said leave me no choice, about to bring noise\nGot to fill this void, I got to be the voice\nWhat the government is doin' amongst our people is downright evil\nDisturbin', but not surprisin', that's for certain\nWith all of the conflict of propaganda, I believe they are simply tryna slander\nStart a Civil War within the USA amongst black and white and those alike\nThey are simply pushin' us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it\nThey want us to rebel, so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails\nAlton Sterlings are happenin' every day in this country and around the world\nThe scary part, boys and girls\nIs most of these stories don't make it to the news and reach mass consciousness\nIt is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement\nAnd accomplishment of what we call human rights\nIt is time to rebel, better yet, raise hell\nI just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it\nBecause this is all part of the government's plan and what they been plottin'\nThey're literally beggin' for this to happen, so they can kill us off\nUsin' uprisin' and rebellion as the excuse in a timely fashion\nThe cancerous foods, the chemical warfare, economic sufferin' is not workin' fast enough\nThere are many steps ahead of us and manifestin' the future that they want\nWe have to work together, not only rattlin' them on a physical plane\nBut to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same\nAs black men, I think our gangs need to do a better job at protectin' us\nThe people, our communities and not assistin' in destroyin' them brutally\nIt's time to even the score\n'Cause who do we call when the police break the law?\nWe are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another\nBut not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other\nThe code words to killin' a black man by police is, \"He's got a gun\"\nDamned if he do, damned if he don't, damned if he runs\nOr what about them? Them murderers got it\nWe need solutions, you better start plottin' now\nIt's always been clear that they don't value our lives\nMy people been sufferin' way too long\nAnd I'm tired of singin' the same old song\nPeople actin' like this shit isn't happenin', it's downright wrong\nJustice won't be served by a hashtag, and that's the very reason I ask that\nWhat are we to do? We're scattered around\nWith no clue of this ugly truth\nAll we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed\nTime to wake the fuck up and do our own research\nAnd not form opinions based on just what we've heard\nAmeri-K-K-K-a is force feedin' you lies down your throats with a silver spoon\nAnd eventually, we'll all be doomed\nReal, real, real soon42Embed\nYeah, uh, uh\nTurn the music up

have my baby\n\nAyo, word to my mother, two things I never do\nIs leave the crib without some rubbers or tell a funky ho I love her\nThese broads be trying to get a brother caught up in a sticky situation\nMissing menstruation cycles\nThey all psycho ask Michael\nBefore you give her dough for billie jeans and them nice clothes\nLike woah don't let them trap you on the tight rope\nSpike holes in the condom to form a zygote\nOvernight, ask Kwon, he know what it's like\nHe wore a hat but it exploded twice\nBut fuck a bad bitch I do this rap shit and put it over life\nOn the coldest nights son shine like a solar strike\nAnd I swear I got the weirdest cases\nPipe chicks in the weirdest places from rooftops to staircases\nLike get a load of their faces\nFace it, if you fear, hate it, you get put into this clear space\n\nI don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'\nI don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'\nI don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'\nThey will never catch me slippin'\nI don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'\nI don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'\nI don't

fume, got me thinking like who gassed you\nYour girl got gas too, she let me tackle for a dutch and a Snapple\nUnless you decide to put on shackles\nI\u2019m that dude, fuck values, pump up the volume\nAll up in the cut, no alcohol, just mad boos\nTryin to find a pad to bring her back to like a tadpole\nI'm that folk, got bad chicks that I feel bad for\nBruising to they back bones, lickin' up my cock tip\nDown to do it all no matter what the synopsis is\nAll it takes is some exotic piff\nThey all unconscious, topless, exposing they crotch and shit\n\nI don't trust these bitches, they

I swear that her love is just a sin\nWe back at it again, fussin' and fightin', I start cussin', she cryin'\nBreak up to make up, I start cuttin' then slide it in\nThen mix the vibe with some Hen, you got five, I got ten\nNow we some trippy niggas as high as a fin\nBut what's your game, love?

Fuck a rou-, let's get shootin'\nThe 47 Goonz recruitin', join or die\nWe comin' for groups of guys in suits and ties\nWho choose to hide truth from the eye\nGrab a white collar by his white evil eye\nFight or flight, yo, that's just what it is\nWhen you see a pig, hit him in his baby back ribs\nBut don't trip, I'm just another black kid, caught up in the mix\nTryna make a dollar outta 47 cents\nYo, this shit is intense, a dumb cop stoppin' me, probably\nCause he's still livin' in the past tense, how shit was back then\nThey wanna see the downfall of all black men\nAnd African, I was sent to put action in\nBut what's new when the po keep flashin' in?\nNews flash niggas, get a news flash\nYou might also like\nWhat's my name?

lives\nAnd I'm high, mix Ciroc and some blunts, \u2018cause you only live once\n\u2018Cause you only live once\n\nWhite girl wasted, my wife-girl hate it\n\u2018Cause when I\u2019m faded I just wanna\nSee her naked\nAdjust adjacent, like baby let me see your matrix\nKama Sutra, back to basics\nSince I was on the go, back to the block\n105 on, started bumpin\u2019 Hard Knock\nI looked at my nigga Fly, as my heart dropped\nSedan in front swervin\u2019 as the car stopped\nIn that split second, my foot steppin\u2019 breakin\u2019\nI thought to myself, I always knew that I would make it\nAll it took was patience, and now I\u2019m on the stations\nLuckily I made it right before my life was taken\nIt was too good to be mistaken for happiness and riches\nPeople callin\u2019 my phone, like they happy that we did it\nLittle did they know I was \u2018bout to meet my maker\nTill an angel came down and told me that my time was later\nYou might also like\nThis the song I wrote if I died;\nI

it\nPass the deuce, 'member creepin\u2019 through the 'jects\nHad to, stash the deuce in my 40 \u2018Low boots\nInternational, my bread is well earned\nL's burn, smash hoes in Melboure\nLight skinned jawn, look like Chanel Imon\nOne night, got her hooked, like I\u2019m heroin\nVintage Vanson's  puffin\u2019 on chron\nPosted, lookin\u2019 like a slim or Daron\nGive me some to a 112 song\nSmoke a nigga like a Newport Long\nPass off to my man, be a baton\n\u2018Cause it ain\u2019t no fun if the homies don\u2019t get none\nRight, it's like ballin' on a bitty\nBunch of bad bitches from different cities\nIllest niggas in New yitty\nKush God, Joey Bada$$, relax and stack the skrilly, DZA\nThis the song I wrote if I died;\nI was on the 50 mile doing 9-5\nBeating the pussy like it ain't got 9

(Uh)\n\nCan't spell \"us\" without \"trust\"\nPut the lust aside, there's some things we gotta discuss\nSo close your legs for a bit, baby, let's open up\nClosed mouths don't get fed finishing lunch, her panties in a bunch\nTell me where you been at these last couple months\nYou say you want me back, so baby, don't front\n'Cause I could never know too much but just enough\nSo the next nigga never feel he got the one-up\nBut we ain't gotta rush, take your time\nWe could talk until the sun up, I see you tryin'\nTo say what's on your mind, I promise to be fine\nI could see the signs, be honest, I ain't blind\nThe truth is we all got our own desires, our own dreams\nIt's a big world, gotta try new things\n\nSo right here, right now, what you gotta say\nYou ain't gotta lie now, it's the bed we made\nYou might also like\nShow me how (Show me how, baby)\nYou care (Right here, right now)\nRight here, right now, right now, baby, yeah\nTell me how (Tell me all)\nYou loved (Tell me how you love, baby)\nBefore (Uh)\n\n'Cause transparency my love language\nCan't see the bigger picture if your vision tangled\nLove is like glass, either break it or you stain it\nThese late-night conversations turn into arraignments, just tell me the truth\n'Cause I ain't tryna judge, baby, I just want you to be you\n'Cause I'ma be me, keep it G like real niggas do\n'Cause you knew a nigga way before he got famous on the block, nameless\nAnd I'm proud to say the money never changed us\nWe've been through many phases like mazes, still we found a way\nI never knew a love that wasn't painless\nPouring out my heart was always draining, I gotta say\nNow every day, it's indigo rain, and yeah, this a brighter day\nA lifetime I provide for you, by the way\nDon't you forget that I would die for you any day\n\nRight here, right now, what you gotta say?\nYou ain't gotta lie now, it's the bed we made, uh\nShow me how (Show me how, baby)\nYou care (Right here, right now)\nRight here, right now, right now, baby, yeah\nTell me how (Tell me all)\nYou loved (Tell me how you loved, baby)\nBefore\n\nYou ain't gotta lie to me, no-no\nI know you would die for me, it's for sure\nBaby girl, this life we live is too short\nBaby girl, this life we live is too short\nYou ain't gotta lie to me, no-no\nI know you would die for me, it's for sure\nBaby girl, this life we live is too short\nYeah, too- it's too short (Too short)\n\nSaid a thug don't cry, no\nBut a thug don't cry, no, and real niggas don't lie\nSaid a thug don't cry, no\nSaid, a thug don't cry, no, and real niggas don't lie\nSaid a thug don't cry, no\nAnd the thug don't cry, no, and real niggas don't lie\nSaid a thug don't cry, no\nThug don't cry, real niggas never lie2Embed\nShow me how\nYou care\n(Statik Selektah, yeah)\nTell me how (Tell me all)\nYou loved (Tell me how you love, baby)\nBefore (Uh)\n\nCan't spell \"us\" without \"trust\"\nPut the lust aside, there's some things we gotta discuss\nSo close your legs for a bit, baby, let's open up\nClosed mouths don't get fed finishing lunch, her panties in a bunch\nTell me where you been at these last couple months\nYou say you want me back, so baby, don't front\n'Cause I could never know too much but just enough\nSo the next nigga never feel he got the one-up\nBut we ain't gotta rush, take your time\nWe could talk until the sun up, I see you tryin'\nTo say what's on your mind, I promise to be fine\nI could see the signs, be honest, I ain't blind\nThe truth is we all got our own desires, our own dreams\nIt's a big world, gotta try new things\n\nSo right here, right now, what you gotta say\nYou ain't gotta lie now, it's the bed we made\n\nShow me how (Show me how, baby)\nYou care (Right here, right now)\nRight here, right now, right now, baby, yeah\nTell me how (Tell me all)\nYou loved (Tell me how you love, baby)\nBefore (Uh)\n\n'Cause transparency my love language\nCan't see the bigger picture if your vision tangled\nLove is like glass, either break it or you stain it\nThese late-night conversations turn into arraignments, just tell me the truth\n'Cause I ain't tryna judge, baby, I just want you to be you\n'Cause I'ma be me, keep it G like real niggas do\n'Cause you knew a nigga way before he got famous on the block, nameless\nAnd I'm proud to say the money never changed us\nWe've been through many phases like mazes, still we found a way\nI never knew a love that wasn't painless\nPouring out my heart was always draining, I gotta say\nNow every day, it's indigo rain, and yeah, this a brighter day\nA lifetime I provide for you, by the way\nDon't you forget that I would die for you any day\n\nRight here, right now, what you gotta say?\nYou ain't gotta lie now, it's the bed we made, uh\n\nShow me how (Show me how, baby)\nYou care (Right here, right now)\nRight here, right now, right now, baby, yeah\nTell me how (Tell me all)\nYou loved (Tell me how you loved, baby)\nBefore\n\nYou ain't gotta lie to me, no-no\nI know you would die for me, it's for sure\nBaby girl, this life we live is too short\nBaby girl, this life we live is too short\nYou ain't gotta lie to me, no-no\nI know you would die for me, it's for sure\nBaby girl, this life we live is too short\nYeah, too- it's too short (Too short)\n\nSaid a thug don't cry, no\nBut a thug don't cry, no, and real niggas don't lie\nSaid a thug don't cry, no\nSaid, a thug don't cry, no, and real niggas don't lie\nSaid a thug don't cry, no\nAnd the thug don't cry, no, and real niggas don't lie\nSaid a thug don't cry, no\nThug don't cry, real niggas never lie"

said she fell in one of them Ls, but lust don't count\nThese chickens don't love me, they love the account\nBut they will never know what's the amount, I keep the hoes in check\n'Til they bounce, don't ever let a chick see you withdrawn\nThese niggas want to know what I draw with\nBut won't respond to what I've drawn\nTetrahedrons, take a dose of Patron\nWith knowledge juice and deuce Cubes of Metatron\nThey wouldn't hear the tone through a megaphone, let alone\nCella phone, but my line stay hella blown\nHella blown, hella blown\n\nYo Houston, we got a problem, copy\nFour, five hotties in the lobby\nSaid that they can blow the rockets properly, but blow up spots and never stop\nLike them aki's, they never get aqui to my property\nKnown around my city like George Pataki\nYoung Jason for them dollars in the mix like teriyaki\nAnd round four, I force my large Versace\nOver my big head, cause I don't live here, she getting too cocky\nWon't spot me in no closet\nI ain't like Kels and

Earth just to shit\nMami, come steer, some new stick, got a man?, I don't give two shits\nBetter tell that doofus deuces before he catch a whipping\nHit him in his Charles Dickens and strip him for his Scottie Pippens\nCause it's all about the big pimping\nRob him for his Nixon, and then question him about his timing\nRight here, it gets reckless, best advice is\nTo tuck your necklace, and put your arms right back into your Lexus\nCause G-Stone Crips, they ain't nothing\nTo flex with, and billy gang Pyru, they really on some next shit\nSo if I were you I would probably ride with two\nNo fool, not two dudes, two tools\nAs in deuce-deuce cause niggas jack you for your soul\nAnd your new shoes and your jewels too\nThere's something about another nigga having shit\nThat have a nigga spazzing clips all up in your back and dip\nCause it's all about bagging the baddest chick\nStacking them chicks up in Saks Fifth\nBut word is bond, you been on\nWord is bond, you been on29Embed\nGot

life I been around crips and bloods\nGrips and slugs, the trigger happiest thugs\nClaiming the slums, and all the hoods that they from\nToo much of the sum, got it twisted up blinded in a rat race\nCash straight, the fake kill jake, the snakes too late\nMy eyes dilate, and I could tell them how he strafe\nComing at me sideways, get straighten up\nDon't deflate it up gimmie the bucks my cash wrinkling up\nLooking back in the days\nAmazed 'cause the lab rat done made it out the maze\nStill feel caged, enraged though\nUsed the underground railroad like a runaway slave\nBroke off the chains still runway fresh\nGot you on that mental plane with my project jet\nI'm two steps above that nimbus cloud\nMy limit is low, when I'm smoking on that loud\nFocus in the now, when the lotus is around\nIt's the Brooklyn sound, a pro found, Biggie would be proud about\nBut I don't need a vet to even shout me out\nPunchlines pack a Pacquiao they can't box me out\nYou might also like\nBig up big up, it's a stick up stick up\nNiggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup\nBig up big up, it's a stick up stick up\nNiggas hit a nigga quick if he hiccup hiccup\nTell me what them know bout the Badmon named Jozif\nWomen come around, I look em down like they don't know shit\nWord around the town is that they got the match explode it\n\nI'm a child of the city\nSon of the streets\nAnd it's just a pity\nThey not tough like we\nAnd things not look pretty\nWhen we got to eat\nThings get much deeper\nDeeper and deeper\nThe belly of the beast\n\nAnd I survive, thank the father\nFeel like I was raised by Clans One Order\nHad to keep calm and hold ma corner\nCause a stray gun shot if you cross the border\nPro Era teach them the pros and cons\nOf living in a city with a thousand dons\nA thousand ghetto youths with a thousand guns\nCold hearted killers with frozen lungs\nBut praise rastafari we wheel and come again\nKnow I Nyabinghi sit know we the drummer dem\nDem ammunition are tougher we power dem\nLightning and thunder a devour them\nPro Era teach them the pros and cons\nOriginal Chronixx and Joe Badmon\nNo King Selassie, we have the golden crown\nGet ready for the shift we are the chosen ones\nI'm a child of the city, city, oooh\n\nI'm a child of the city\nSon of the streets\nAnd it's just a pity\nThey not tough like we\nAnd things not look pretty\nWhen we got to eat\nThings get much deeper, oh no\nDeeper and deeper\nThe belly of the beast\n\nI'm a child of the city, city, oooh city\nThe belly of the beast\nBeen get real ugly\nI got to eat\nNow every man has

know how it feel walking out the door pockets out of dough\nOut it doe, be on the flow\nWe smoking indo, but we out though, adios\nMy audio getting me that Audi dough or the range rov\nMahogany colored clothing, my hog in the road\nDrive slow, cruising down memory lane before I hit the streets\nHave my melody playing, creators choose flight with my melancholy saying\nHead between clouds, I think I'm married to Jane\nI remember the days when I'd forever complain\nThat's way before they started paying, I was in pain\nSick in the brain like I never met a physicist yet\nOnly lyricist on my metaphysics intellect\n\nSweet dreams, stuck in the 90s\n90s babies it's a matter of timing\nSweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga\nSweet dreams, stuck in the 90s\n90s babies it's a matter of timing\nAnd time's not rewinding, yeah\n\nRound two bout, half of this loud through\nDon't let them hounds snoop and get soundproofed\nHigh frequency sounds too\nHas statik spot over serious statik shots\nScrap vinyls over them statik pops\nIm a fanatic fly but a sporadic guy\nNever chat a lot, just pass the Lye and guide the youth\nStand with the truth, Nigga nothin' less\nWhen the playbutton pressed\nKillswitches feel it hit ya chest\nAnd meet your death, if im caught on the fence know hell hit ya\nYes true vets keeps it real whichya\nIll wit ya, show you the real picture\nOnly keep the ones around that suffer for meals whichya\nCuz when them suckas, see ya supper\nAnd your cake getting richer and your pockets getting thicker\nThats when they want you to remember a nigga\nBut when I handed you the tape you couldn't remember to listen\nYou might also like\nSweet dreams, stuck in the 90s\n90s babies it's a matter of timing\nSweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet

still trippy\nWhere I live it's either you know talents well and sell records\nOr no talent, well we still sell for the record\nSomehow the rap game reminds me of the trap game\nIn fact is the exact same, and these tracks is my crack caine\nAnd if you listening then you a fiend\nOur music is the cure like some vaccines\nExotic to the core so stop asking\nGot the blueprints to the game, but I read it as king\nThere's 47 ways to get this green\nOne is being an enslaved being, the other dreams\nRed pill or blue bean, I can't sit still I'm too lean, nigga\nBrush my bill on on new beams\nNiggas on my tail now that I blew green\n\nSweet dreams, stuck in the 90s\n90s babies it's a matter of timing\nSweet dreams my nigga, I wish you sweet dreams my nigga\nSweet dreams, stuck in the 90s\n90s babies

so gray\nSometimes I really need to get away, yeah\nI just need to get away, yeah\nI just need to get away, yeah\nSometimes I really need to fly away\n\nI could never forget them gloomy days\nAlthough I regret where my time was placed\nIf I could go back, some things would be changed\nAnd I would know that, for a fact, it was fame\nThat drew me to this unfamiliar side of my brain\nThat withdrew me from familiar and the closest remains\nAlthough I'm gaining ends now, I'm losing friends\nThey say that time is money, and my time is well spent\nGirlfriend hit me up to chill, but does this shit make sense?\nAnd I don't expect for you to know if you ain't paying rent\nI got to make this album, and hold it down for my camp\nSurrounded us all like bonfire\nWhen I lay a verse down that's more fire, I was born fire, uhh\nYou might also like\nAnd here's an ode to the worst of my days\nI've been working away\nBut the sky's been looking so gray\nSometimes I really need to get away, yeah\nI just need to get away, yeah\nI just need to get away, yeah\nSometimes I really need to fly away\n\nWent outside this morning, morning, uh\nSeen the sky was falling, falling, yeah\nOld man no longer snoring, snoring, ah\nThe rain just won't stop pouring, pouring, uh\nWhat's heaven's capitol like, like, li-like?\nMaybe I can crash tonight, night, night\nCause I'm trapped inside this hell, hell, hole\nGod, please answer your cell, cell, phone\nI'm coming home tonight, can't touch no microphone tonight\nOutside my comfort zone tonight\nMy brain's blown out my dome tonight\nTonight's the night, don't you try to put up a fight\nDon't you trying looking for light\nCause I'm bout to take that flight\n\nAnd here's an ode to the worst of my days\nI've been working away\nBut the sky's been looking so gray\nSometimes I really need to get away, yeah\nI just need to get away, yeah\nI just need to get away, yeah\nSometimes I really need to fly away\nIndigo father, meant to go farther\nAnd travel across the water and pocket a million dollars\nI am the spirit, I am the guava\nYou sippin' out of your coconut beverage in the Bahamas\nPardon me mother, pardon me father\nI'm glad that you split apart it was part of my firestarter\nAlong with niggas, bitches, and ballers\nAnd people that look down on me like they so taller\nI go harder, I grow smarter\nThe flow's water, like Osama\nOughta gropple every dollar, every single piece of change\nMove into the woods so I'll never ever change\nLose a couple friends but I'll never ever change\nI probably miss some money but I never ever change\nAnd they can say whatever but I never ever change\nI feel I understood why the stars went insane\nUmmmm brain battered from scattering every Saturday\nPitter patter with people that really matter\nAnd I'mma fuck up regardless cause I'm a kid right?\nThat's why you can't spell summer without trouble\nStripper with no bubble, threesome with no double\nLove without hate, life without pain\nThis without that, choice without thought\nA dog with no day, a Seattle without rain\nIf it rains in Seattle\nI'll saddle up and then you can ride with ya nigga\nFly with ya nigga, high with ya nigga\nVibe with me nigga, say vibe with me nigga\nSay, if it rains in Seattle\nI'll take you 'round the world on a Sunday\nWith me, one day, one day now\nOne day now, one day, one day\nIf it rains in

saint, the holy ghost up in my aura rebuked it\nIt\u2019s the era of indigo and they go with the preaching\nI ascend as the seasons, go on and I vanish\nCause I notice I\u2019m slowly becoming way more imbalanced\nA king with the crown, firm grip on the chalice\nSolid gold angel coming back to burn down this Babylon\nHas told many tales, his flows you could sells\nMastering wind elements, I move with the gales\n\u2018Cause I\u2019m a socialite in the night, bitch get right enable\nI\u2019m boxing yo dorm, put my Nikes on the coffee table\nMy tongue\u2019s below her navel, she makes it wet, her skills are naval\nSeals my hands on her extremities, we\u2019re chopping up these remedies\nCame in between her and I\nWe leave it to the constellations like should we continue relations?\nI think not cause all I do is smoke pot\nAnd make beats, and yo ass just want back shots\nYou might also like\nSmoker\u2019s club, Michael Jordan how I\u2019m killing 4 quarters\nYou stashing the trash, hoarder\nYo girl starting to bath water, it\u2019s Dirty\nAnd that\u2019s not an introduction, it\u2019s nutching\nDirt on my shoulders, like Hova\nMy niggas turn boulders soft, that\u2019s the shit that me and jovid saw uh\nAnd now its like Pro Era in stores\nAll my niggas opening doors\nAll my bitches is braless, flawless more or less\nBalance was the key, more action less speaking\nEverybody wants a piece\nPeace\nCheck\n(Peace)\nYo\n\nWhen I release the flows I goes over yo dome far\nThe nigga to represent the barrio, we hold bars\nI shine further, you sons get in the bogart\nYou gotta pick yo road, give it a go, keep the point, God\nBetter with the regis my mind, they manifesting\nBeast coast, yea we the pros, you don\u2019t wanna mess with\nWe leave you breathless, don\u2019t second guess the best who blessed it\nLess than yo adolescence when I speak my progression\nBring it down baby\nBring it down baby, uh\n\nThis is what I asked for, asked for\nChilling at my back door, back off, mind tweaking on bath salts\nConfuse my intelligence, maybe I\u2019m irrelevant\nSo eloquent, being riders with a elephant\nThe higher rank tryna pull a trump card\nWhen I try and do the things, I deserve all respect\nIntricit my amount, boy to any amount\nTo any account, probably I gets em out uh\nI can see it through the pyramids\nI can see it through the pyramids\nI can see it through the pyramids\nI must admit, I must admit\n\nThe mental state with a nigga that was penciled for great\nFollowing schedules, never scheduled for break\nBut still embrace he'll put ya' neck in a brace\nRegular days went to getting paid regular\nRespecting the Era where the Era\u2019s been ascending up\nGot all types of fans that\u2019s always sending us love\nAnd ex girls that I loved I now offend with a glove\nAnd stayed deeper but still heading above\n\u2018Cause Mr. Hinds always gotta float to let the people know that nigga head is above\nRegular sea height, cause they 3rd eye never seen height\nCause only this Brooklyn street light gave me shine to shine for these nights\nCame with the free ice to bag bodies on the beat sipes\nBring it down baby\nBring it down baby, uh\n\nLooking for who\u2019s in charge, don\u2019t be shocked, I\u2019m the plug\nGet inside like the socket, the surgeon, the sergeant\nEnergy \u2013 I put all in\nI\u2019m learning the flaw things\nIn the storm you stand out, you can struck and stand up\nI know how to conduct, feelings electric\nWell we\u2019re connected, your buttons are pressing\nCan test the reception, I sent you a message\nLet me know if you get this, the question\n\nSeen it all in the retrospect, took retro steps\nLike it\u2019s \u201993 still, got \u201993 til mic skills\nEven got the ecko check\nLike for real there no testing, my tribe is not some Tribe called Questions\nMy professions are not no seconds\nTo no veterans and they minutes of fame\nI\u2019m a menace, insane, minus the brain as I diminish the flame\nMake it rain, champagne, 'til it falls down the drain\nGot my head up in my dreams\nEverything ain't what it be seemin'\nDon\u2019t blame me girl, blame my semen\nYou got good jeans so your inseams made seamless\nAnd off top, you\u2019re ingenious\nWe took a hit of of the greenest\nNow she at most fear on the atmosphere but don't intervene us\nBreak her body down to the genus if she leaving\nShe didn\u2019t get the pic and now I see Sophia\nShe get the tone, sorry Bonita but\nSophia got a applebum\nSophia got a applebum\nI\u2019m thinking I should take it home\nWhat you saying?\n\nWho do you think Bonita Applebum is?\nI think Bonita Applebum is...\nHold on before you even talk, you ever been with a Bada$$ nigga?\nDon't answer that, don't answer that\nBonita Applebum,

this shit with you\nYou feel me, and you gon' be good\nLike I can't, cause you my friend and I can't protect niggas\"\nLike all I can tell niggas is sit n' pray and that's it\nBut niggas be taking their life for granted like\nYou know being on some wild cowboy shit, you can't\nYou got beef with some nigga like, don't be in their vicinity my nigga\u2026\nI feel it\nSoul music\n\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSaid I don't know why do I live my life this way\nWhy do I live my life this way\nYo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes\nCan testify I'm the best of fly\nLive your life and I'm gon' live mine\n\nTell me what the fuck an angel does\nWe're seeing kids who ain't aged enough\nGetting high off angel dust\nFrom NY to Los Angeles\nThere ain't no love\nIn the heart of the city\nLooking where they car be at\nAnd they party at\nCardiac arrest can feel risky\nReal pissy I chase cheese and real pussy yeah\nCats used to yawn on his rap now look at 'em\nShit ain't been the same since them niggas started booking 'em\nPull up with your pen up, looking sharper than a bulletin\nWith pin stripes and hollow tip bullets in it\nHe's something that you'd invest in\nCatch him live on late night, but he ain't interestin'\nPop up and poop out something like intestine\nNo corrections cause the mic been checked in\nThe only time he be asking is when he sexing\nMy team like teenage mutants and X-men\nFire spark when I step in\nHe the human torch\nInhaling fumes of all sorts of course\nSteez taught me how to store it in my ball shorts\nSo when we stop by the D we never get caught\nI say it again we face L's but never lost\nEither be a warlord for 6 fees short\nEach day in this living hell feel remorse\nBut he had a million dollar smile way before he flossed\nYou might also like\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSaid I don't know why do I live my life this way\nWhy do I live my life this way\nYo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes\nCan testify I'm the best of fly\nLive your life and I'm gon' live mine\n\nYo, I'm trying to Oprah win-win with a \"L\" in my hand\nRemotely passed off like the generous man\nAnd they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand\nBut don't understand they the only one who gets the benefit, damn\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nThey couldn't walk this way in my J's\nIt wouldn't feel despair, but disarray\nLike their souls disappear\nSon got hot flows, got dropped like disarray\nCouldn't close my ghost souls, eyes closed\nCovered with Ray-Bans, I call it my eyes closed, and I know!\nEven through shades of black\nI see brighter days looking back in fact\nSo I relax my mind, see what these tracks can find\nA gold mine that will make me rich in both dimes in mine\nGotta make it all mine if you don't mind\nCause sometimes\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSaid I don't know why do I live my life this way\nWhy do I live my life this way\nYo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes\nCan testify I'm the best of fly\nLive your life and I'm gon' live mine\n\nRight on the block where they sit and play\nLives the vicious ways where they spit and spray\nVicious trey's coming for the ice you kept in yesterday\nIt's nothing but the history\nProtecting ya' from being history\nAnd then the next day your face is just a mystery\nFor niggas who really ain't feeling me are all my fucking enemies\nEven the lightest hours requires heavy artillery\nAccelerate without the breaks of a break\nAnd still I'm not eating up to now and there's a lot on my plate\nAll in a day's work of God and his grace\nYou wanna eat then tell God and say grace\nAnd avoid the heat getting the boil to surface\nA soft nigga caught between these rocks and a hard place\nBecause the Mafia is on the look out for the Scarface\nBut the ill-minded child, is ill minded child\nGot a round of styles\nKilling niggas' mental like a round of shells\nVery well rounded, round it well 'til the highest number\nPraying that 2047 ain't the highest number\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSometimes I just sit and pray\nSaid I don't know why do I live my life this way\nWhy do I live my life this way\nYo, said the apex rhymes on the empire's eyes\nCan testify I'm the best of fly\nLive your life and I'm gon' live mine\n\nGet off my cheeks let me

just how i do\nWhen it rains it pours down\nUsed to wanna be king said the reign is on now\nKing me like James straight out of High School\nTo the big games but you know just how i do\n\nAdapted to these new ways of living, getting money and sinning\nGo together like denims diamonds and women\nTryna balance it at once but keep hitting these blunts\nDemons of lust, keep hinting they stunts when I'm drunk\nWhat if I jumped off this cloud full of thinking aloud\nInto a, pool of my sorrow and start sinking in doubt\nRethinking it out, 'cause tomorrow ain't ever promising\nAnd ever blink it counts for a prophet who see deposits\nBut he ain't always see the positives\nHe used to live in poverty, Thinking probably\nOne day, he strike the lottery\n'Cause dreaming big never been odd to me\nAnd since a kid Ive been on a musical odyssey\nI knew the day would come where I wouldn't be sorry in a pile of G's\nOr probably be rehearsing a verse on the beach\nWait reverse in the speech\n'Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side\nBut I'll stop shining when bunnies fly\nYou might also like\nWhen it rains it pours down\nUsed to wanna be king said the reign is on now\nKing me like James straight out of High School\nTo the big games but you know just how i do\n\nI turn my dreams to reality\nSo, I burn green same time I burn calories though\nI'm eating now in fact, I'm feasting now\nNo more mistreating, my miss is treated now\nNo more misleading mister leader now\nMister visa now, I got green and cards with no limits\nBad boy life but shyne with no diddy\nBut it's no biggie, I spread love the Brooklyn way\nBut when push come to shove I'm bout that Crooklyn wave\nShook for days, Don't ever judge a book by a page\nThat could be a cover up if you ain't looking that way\nBut what can I say, everything happens for a reason\nTime will tell 'cause even fall lasts for a season\nSo keep on believing, you live and learn die and you teach\nAnother, piece of the pie and it's finally sweet\nBut reverse on the speech, 'cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side\nBut I'll stop shining when bunnies fly\n\nWhen it rains it pours down\nUsed to wanna be king said the reign is on now\nKing me like James straight out of High School\nTo the big games but you know just how i do\nSaid we done came a long way 365 bong rips later\nLast year I ain't make no paper\nAll I earned was some kicks some snares from some haters\nAnd some favors from some chicks that move there rumps like shakers\nBut what's that shit, I was tryna be the greatest\nUpgrade to the grade A list, but all they do is degrade us\nAnd it ain't to hard to be famous, Whats hard is sustaining\nRemaining the same when stuff changing\n'Cause I remember days at the bus station, waiting\nStill had no patience, so niggas try to play him\nImaginary players, Imaginary playlist\nI been your favorite before you even started playing it\nWho\u2019d of thought the day would come I wouldn\u2019t be sorry\nIn a pile of g's, and rehearse a verse on the beach\nBut reverse on the speech\n'Cause it ain't always sunny on the sunny side\nBut I'll stop shining when bunnies fly\n\nWhen it rains it pours down\nUsed to wanna be king said the reign is on now\nKing me like James straight out of High School\nTo the big games but you know just how i do\n14Embed\nWhen it rains it pours down\nUsed to wanna

Nothing but a fucking disgrace, nigga\nYou might also like\nCheck\nThis ain't quiddtch but you know the snitch get caught\nThen get bitched like the bitch she brought, throw your fit then walk\nWhen they clip all of your Christmas thoughts\nThere's no giving when they take what you got\nPlaced in the crop circle, doc with a smock, see\nArt what we drop, shopping cart with Da Vinci\nWhimpering, leave that risk to your Pros\nWrist full of stone, lapidate if they pass me the smoke\nI'm strapped and irate, daps from the fake\nGet me mad and I contemplate irrational mode\nDon't think about nada, strung you by your collar\nThe flow father who balanced out his chromosomes proper\nI'm going home partner like Posada, they talk beef\nBut toss the ensalada, peep the blue Impala\nThere's arrogant cops who stay intruding\nCan't stop the 47 like protagonist in Absolution\nThem wack rappers who track-eluding\nCritic is a random student who use the Era as a new rap influence\nFaster than ransom shootings or some cancer fluid\nI still kill and you can't lose it15Embed\nThis is from the real side\n\nYo, Badass don't act or pretend, back at it again\nHit it from the back, she a addict within\nI got her on some shit like \"I'm a get tatted for him\"\nShe a ride or die, slim, when she in the denims\nRemember it like it was yesterday\nAnother case of \"I fucked your bitch, nigga\" but a more clever way\nQuarter in the room to elevate, said if you ever may\nSlip then hit her on the hip where the Beretta stay\nCatch me somersaulting my eyelids\nAwakened from a dream, just perceived how I live\nSo it's make believe, rather unique\nLavish, sweet all live in a rapper physique\nHit up a show then after retreat back to the telly with freaks\nPack up a bowl and we ain't even eat\nBut we got a appetite for cookie creases and treats\nAnd they all got tricks up they sleeve\n\nI'm ashing on the bridge, Mary Jane, fuck your cigarettes\nI'm laughing out loud, ask me if I'm still stressed, possessed\nHope the boys in blue don't arrest yours truly\nRespect but suspect, protect your neck jewelry\n47s and Uzis, well-connected and recruiting\nI be with my Mexicans, I know they got the toolie\nI'm smoking doobies with like 20 of my goons\nHotbox the whip and let smoke fill the room\nEven through my lenses, my sense is on the moon\nDirty be the name and I came from the black lagoon\nI'm sick with the ink like infected tattoos\nJust one love but the two-three's branded on my shoes\nYou would think I had a eighth the way I'm crushing them grapes\nHad her whining for a taste, that's why she's up in my face\nThem Apex taking over like we running with Apes\nWhat's the verdict?

coming heavy\n\nI hope you ready, cause its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around\nSo make way through the crowd\nSwimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown\nJust trying to make waves with the sound\nWhen my shit drop bitch turn it up loud\nAnd tune them other niggas out\nI'm the youngest nigga repping everytime I'm stepping out\nAnd if you step outside your face we pop up right in front of your house\n\nNiggas think because we conscious we don't really get it popping\nThey forgot we from the bottom\nThey forgot we had to fight for every nickel, every dollar\nBefore the money and the power\nYou could ask my nigga Powers I've been putting in these hours\nPlotting domination now the whole world is ours\nTell me why they hating, its cause of what I'm making\nAnd if you a little patient its gon' be what I'm taking\nThey got me mistaken\nCritics try to box me\nI feel like Rocky when it come to paparazzi\nSomebody stop me, fucking up my kamikaze\nI'm on my 47 shit, like how could you not see\nCause we dropping jewels I said we dropping jewels\nTemper rising cools prolly see me on the news\nJoey got the juice, finally got this nigga loose\nNow while I'm free to speak free my nigga Shmurda too\nI'm feeling like Victor Cruz a giant from New York\nI'm lacing up the boots then I'm going fucking long\nSo if you trying to score just pass it to me more\nNever dropping the ball, always raising the bar\nYou might also like\nMan it's gon' be a real long time I'mma be around\nSo make way through the crowd\nSwimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown\nJust trying to make waves with the sound\nWhen my shit drop bitch turn it up loud\nAnd tune them other niggas out\nI'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now\nAll these others niggas thinking they from the south\n\nBitch I'm the bomb even HOV said it\nThough I never signed to ROC and no I don't regret it\nYou know I'm coming for the top you see me getting bigger\nHow can you sign if you know you're tryna beat a nigga\nWhen I made it to his office I was seventeen\nLike forty floors up I grew a pair of wings\nIn that moment man I knew I could do anything\nFeeling like a young Simba can't wait to be a king\nAnd I never lost my hunger man I stayed hungry\nIf we started talking numbers man they wouldn't love me\nMan I'd rather keep the peace but its getting ugly\nBut fuck it what I'm about to say is what they didn't want me\n60k first week for the Bada$$\n200k to this day I know you niggas mad\nWith the 80/20 split my nigga do the math\nMy nigga Kirk just outsold Troy Ave\nNow they sleep we 'bout to hit 'em with the NYCK next\nGot these niggas bread hurt, Limp Bizkit\nIts crunch time had to go and get his shit wreck\nGot the ninjas on deck and bitches in check\nAnd that's a shot to anybody man I don't feel you\nSteezy told me to go hard and niggas ain't hear you\nI see the whole future clearer and I'm near it too\nAnd if you really break a leg, I hope they still will cheer you\nMan its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around\nSo make way through the crowd\nSwimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown\nJust trying to make waves with the sound\nWhen my shit drop bitch turn it up loud\nAnd tune them other niggas out\nI'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now\nTell these other niggas I'm coming for the crown\n\nReady or not here I come, you can't hide\nTell me is you ready is you really ready\nNah they ain't really ready they ain't never ready\nReady or not here I come, you can't hide\nReady or not here I come, you can't hide\nTell me is

blood cousin\nWhen you're buzzing\nFine, I give 'em my other line, another rhyme\nWord to mother, I'm goosed up\nMy two fucks in two cups\nAnother double entendre\nShe fell in that Bombay\nNow she tumble dry lingerie\nChardonnay nothing but the bottle of emotion\nBut the love potion when it sprays\nThey just caught up in the days\nLet me show you how I feel these Jays\nThe cheese stays high like Dr. J\nMy flow is like land the boats, dock the planes\nHand the dope but cop the chains\nFor more fiends some antidote to stop the pain\nNow my stream, floods these streets\nThey can't stop the reign\nAll right I need them back\nTo blast, to blast me out of sight\nLike a satellite\nVibe all night\nA satellite\nYou might also like\nI take a day off\nLet the trees take some weight off\nMy mental's just a fact, Bannon's got the instrumental\nI keep niggas on their toes\nSo you got creases in your Forces\nMy verses they're important, yo your verses they are boring\nI am not of this Earth bro\nI'm a satellite that's bound to fight\nBut we're down to light, 'n light the fuck up\nVibe all night\n\nAs I roll the dice\nLike my first drink was just the brink of a crooked eye\nBut don't blame the ice for the I U KEL\nOh God couldn't see past 'em\nIf his puff pass, notarized\nTwo dubs I got 40 on my hit list\nJust smoking drinks both the broken in-glass like old English\nAre you good bro?\nIs your eyes dilated from the kush 'n Nuvo?\nThis new for the life\nLike a Nubian with the doobie cold eyes\nBetter smell the coffee I'mma coughing\nThat means I'm sick widdit, spit it out\nKill it like airborne diseases\nIs this why the rap game is this easy?\nLike please eat your vegetables\nSo I took a dose of the edible\nAin't an overdose\nAlready a rap monster fucking overload\nHopping up on stepping stones\nSo we making stepping stones\nTurn up that tichrome\nWe rap game dose\nThis is Messiah and the eyes are hopeless\nHopin' my divide eyes through the world flex\nThis shit\nDon't this shit make my people wanna jump?\nNo disrespect, ask my man for the pumps\nDon't this shit\nTo blast, to blast me out of sight like a satellite\nDon't this shit make my people wanna jump?\nNo

chakra\nNo time for the roster this rap game goes either way\nLet him lead the way\nAnd niggas will know who they need to play\nFreeing the ways to amplify the idiolect\nSaw nothing but shots since the project days\nLike I was eyin' the Tec\nKept the eye in the text\nMake 'em see my eye in the Lex\nGiving my blood sweat and iron injecting selecting the soul\nCause mind body and soul can't be reinstalled\nSpecial with the flow to make Niagara fall\nIt's over for the systematic rapping robotics\nCrashing my logic\nThese niggas hooked on hooks and Hooked on Phonics\nWith hooked on phonics the pot could get em hooked on chronic\nCause pain conditions from the page conditions\nRacing like Sonic inhaling the tonic\nThey couldn't grade my brain in a college\nThemes behind it rob you for ya mind like thieves is behind it\nSo we had to squeeze in knowledge\nTo pile it when the green sees wallet\nAnything to let the green seize wallet\nTaking forever and a century with sentence speeds\nLike a penitentiary to build cell blocks to block your memory\nCatch me on the enemy's territory\nTelling terrorist story with a terror\nThe Era ends with a good night story\nDon't this shit

comin'\nI used to drive my mama bucket, ridin' 'round frontin'\nOn Snyder Avenue, buildin' number thirty-four-hunnid\nI gave this shit my all or nothin', now my bank bussin'\nI'm livin' plush', new crib cost a milli' plus\nSix figures on every art piece that's hangin' up\nYou little niggas still spendin' on the obvious\nAnd if you think I'm flexin' now, just wait 'til I re-up\nAnd just to sum it up, we shinin' all year long\nWhen I was comin' up, they tried to tell me that was wrong\nI had to run it up, and now I'm right where I belong\nIf all my niggas dead and gone, I gotta carry on\n\nI pray the Lord have mercy on a nigga soul\nWe reminiscin', reminiscin' like it's all we know\nTake hollow tips and extra clips everywhere we go\n'Cause I be takin' risk every time that I hit the door\nI pray the Lord have mercy on a nigga soul\nWe reminiscin', reminiscin' like it's all we know\nTake hollow tips and extra clips everywhere we go\n'Cause I be takin' risk every time that I hit

really last forever\nLike the past, the future don't exist, I know it's now or never\nFocused on the present, know my presence is a gift\nJust so happen to be good at rappin', that would be my niche\nI was only like six when my cousin Richie Rich\nWrote my first verse for me that I would never forget\nAnd since then I was never known to leave a microphone alone\nOften took the long way home just to get thoughts off my dome\nMama blowin' up my phone, leave her message at the tone\nI was gettin' in my zone, at times I felt so alone\nLike how it feel to know that you the best and nobody know\nEvery punchline a chin check and a body blow\nWith all disrespect, you niggas still ain't fuckin' with me though\nAnd never was\nEvery time they thought they had me down, I just leveled up\nThey all saw it\nI'm from Brooklyn, I rep Brooklyn all day\nThey killed Biggie\nY'all niggas is killin' us and you fuckin'\u2014\nThis world is about money, money revolve around money\nJust know that I'm from Brooklyn\nI pray the Lord have mercy on a nigga soul\nWe reminiscin', reminiscin' like it's all we know\nTake hollow tips and extra clips everywhere we go\n'Cause I be takin' risk every time that

combination like this shit was second nature\nLayin' down the law like this shit is legislature\nAlligator jaws sayin' ain't nobody greater\nI bow my head and do my numbers like it's nothin' major\nOver time, I've been too humble, time to up the wager\nEight figures later, got my life all figured out\nGotta have tunnel vision if you wanna make it out\nNo fear of missin' out\nTen thousand hours in, now it's time to make it count\nInvestin' ten percent of whatever in my bank account\nJust in case we see bad weather, I hid a nice amount\nYou don't really lose on stocks, never, 'less you take 'em out\nThinkin' 'bout puttin' some equity in another house\nThin line between brevity and longevity\nOne thing I never sacrifice is integrity\nI ain't nothin' like these rappers, it's a disparity\nNone of these niggas is seein' me, just for clarity\nRest in peace to STEEZ and Jun', they put the battery inside my back\nNow I'm back to leave a casualty and flee the scene casually\nI ain't even gotta aim, it's all hip accuracy\nAmen in Jesus name, my niggas still gon' blast for me\nNiggas got audacity thinkin' they could come after me\nRunnin' this shit on these tracks just like an athlete\nAutomatic classic when Joey get on a Statik beat\nAll my bars appreciate with time like a Patek Philippe\nOoh, I been thrivin'\nNew Presi' on my wrist, call it Joe Biden\nIf I shoot, I never miss, I'ma keep firin'\nThe flow tyrant, I woke up and chose violence\nProduct of my environment walkin' in my alignment\nI'm the reason why niggas talkin' 'bout retirement\nI'm the reason why niggas often have been silent\nBow down to your highness, Brooklyn's finest\nThis flow make 'em think there's something wrong with they sinus\nI came up from the underground and had to keep climbin'\nI peep game like Jay, that's why he didn't sign us\nSaid keep the game at bay like the 49ers\n47 shit, Steezy lookin' down smilin'\nStars keep alignin' so we gotta keep shinin'\nI'm rare cut like a motherfuckin' pink diamond\nThe irony, I been the one you niggas underminin', nigga\nThis is somethin' to remind 'em\nHidden in the rough, where you find 'em\nShine so bright that it just might blind 'em\nYour favorite rappers wouldn't be enough if you combined them niggas\nYou might also like\nSomething in the way you make me feel\nNo tolerance for violators, that won't fly haters\nFeel,

(Bitch)\nSurrounded by my angels (Right), they cover every angle (Facts)\nBack up on my feet and now the Devil tryna tango (Yeah)\nSometimes the pot of gold is the rainbow (Sometimes it is)\nI said, \"Sometimes, the pot of gold is,\" fuck it\n\nLong as the wheels keep turnin' and fire keep burnin'\nThen you know us real niggas don't stop\nLong as the world keep spinnin' and my girl keep grinnin'\nThen you know we gon' make it to the top\nWe just wanna be loved, oh\nWe don't wanna be judged\nWe wanna be accepted\nNever wanna be neglected\nWe just wanna be loved\n\nLook, uh\nMy nigga just left the pen' and he been tryna get back on his feet\nHis father died, he was inside, said the cancer beat 'em\nBaby momma playin' hide and seek with his lil' legacy\nAllegedly she fuck with some lil' nigga that's 'bout to wedding ring her\nPO on his ass, he can't have so much as a misdemeanor\nOr he goin' back, he doin' bad so he been heavy drinkin'\nShow him love for Heaven's sake but I don't know what the hell he thinkin'\nA cycle that we gotta break or we just run in place\nOne hand could wash the other, both hands could wash the face\nI'ma stand beside my brother, take the stand and fabricate\nMake sure that you good, you need a hug, you need a handshake\nNigga back in the hood, he need some money so he antsy\nAnd he buggin' and thuggin', name buzzin' in the city\nWith the safety on the semi like Xavier McKinney\nGiant world, niggas' mind too mini\nAin't too many minorities seen the possibilities\nDodgin' enemies, mind jittery, lookin' to find an identity\nNiggas be flodgin', niggas be finicky, I hope you try to forgive me\nIf you gon' ride with me then ride with me, got a Glock-9 and God with me\nGotta watch mine, keep eyes with me at the stop sign\n\nLong as the wheels keep turnin' and fire keep burnin'\nThen you know us real niggas don't stop\nLong as the world keep spinnin' and my girl keep grinnin'\nThen you know we gon' make it to the top\nWe just wanna be loved\nWe don't wanna be judged\nWe wanna be accepted\nNever wanna be neglected\nWe just wanna be loved\n\nBlessings come like one-and-one, baby\nBut you crossed my mind\nWe all pressed for time\nI think now's the time\nWhy you act so hard to find, baby?\nIt blows my mind\nThis might define crazy\nI be losin' my mind, baby"
