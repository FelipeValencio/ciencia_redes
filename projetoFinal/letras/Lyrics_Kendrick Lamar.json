  "plain": "Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper and songwriter from Compton, California.\n\nHe first gained major attention after the release of his 2010 mixtape O(verly) D(edicated). In 2011, his album Section.80, released exclusively through iTunes, instantly ranked as one of the top digital hip-hop releases of the year. In 2012, he crossed over to mainstream audiences with his major label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, which was widely regarded as an instant classic. In 2015, he released To Pimp a Butterfly to widespread acclaim. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart. The following year, untitled unmastered. was released by surprise. In April of 2017, Kendrick released DAMN. on Good Friday. After five years of silence, on May 13, 2022, Kendrick released his fifth studio album, Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers.\n\nKnown for his storytelling, imagery, wordplay, passion and varied song structures, Kendrick brings hard-hitting lyricism with narratives to the West Coast, not traditionally known for its lyricists.\n\nKendrick Lamar\u2019s position within the rap game is held incredibly high. Lamar was ranked at No. 2 on Billboard\u2019s 10 Best Rappers of All Time list, alongside artists like Jay-Z, Nas, Notorious B.I.G. and more. He has also been nominated for 47 Grammy Awards and has won 17 of them; with three for Best Rap Album. He is also the only rapper to win all of the Grammy Awards in the rap field at the same ceremony, doing so in 2016 and 2018.\n\nLamar is a member of the hip-hop collective Black Hippy, along with Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul\u2014all of whom came up together as a part of Top Dawg Entertainment; however, in 2022, it was announced that Kendrick would be departing TDE following the release of his fifth studio album. He is also signed to Dr. Dre\u2019s Aftermath Entertainment imprint, under Interscope Records.\n\nIn February of 2018, Kendrick and TDE released Black Panther: The Album (Music from and Inspired by). It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. In April, later the same year, he won the Pulitzer Prize in music for his album, DAMN.\n\nSeveral years of relative inactivity followed, with Kendrick only resurfacing for features or collaborative efforts. In March of 2020, Lamar and Dave Free launched PgLang, a production company whose name stands for \u201cprogram language.\u201d In August 2021, Kendrick launched a new website, where he proceeded to announce the release date for his next project in April of 2022. Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers appeared on Friday, May 13, as promised\u2014a double album five years in the making.\n\nKendrick would finally surface again in 2024 with a surprise feature on Future and Metro Boomin\u2019s March collaboration, \u201cLike That.\u201d This verse kicked off Kendrick\u2019s well-documented battle against Drake which saw the Compton MC release four diss tracks. The most popular of which, \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d would become Kendrick\u2019s second solo number one single. The track\u2019s music video would release on July 4, two months after its initial release.\n\nComing off the heel of the battle, Kendrick would announce his Superbowl Half Time performance via his own social media accounts on September 8, 2024. On November 22, 2024, K-Dot released his much anticipated sixth studio album, GNX, after teasing the project only thirty minutes beforehand."

Just play this when you eighteen\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nDear Sandra\nYour son got some habits, I hope you don't undermine them\nEspecially with all the girls that's hurt inside this climate\nYou a woman, so you know how it feels to be in alignment\nWith emotion, hopin' a man can see you and not be blinded\nDear Dennis, you gave birth to a master manipulator\nEven usin' you to prove who he is is a huge favor\nI think you should ask for more paper, and more paper\nAnd more, uh, more paper\nI'm blamin' you for all his gamblin' addictions\nPsychopath intuition, the man that like to play victim\nYou raised a horrible fuckin' person, the nerve of you, Dennis\nSandra, sit down, what I'm about to say is heavy, now listen\nMm-mm, your son's a sick man with sick thoughts, I think niggas like him should die\nHim and Weinstein should get fucked up in a cell for the rest their life\nHe hates Black women, hypersexualizes 'em with kinks of a nympho fetish\nGrew facial hair because he understood bein' a beard just fit him better\nHe got sex offenders on ho-VO that he keep on a monthly allowance\nA child should never be compromised and he keepin' his child around them\nAnd we gotta raise our daughters knowin' there's predators like him lurkin'\nFuck a rap battle, he should die so all of these women can live with a purpose\nI been in this industry twelve years, I'ma tell y'all one lil' secret\nIt's some weird shit goin' on and some of these artists be here to police it\nThey be streamlinin' victims all inside of they home and callin' 'em tender\nThen leak videos of themselves to further push their agendas\nTo any woman that be playin' his music, know that you're playin' your sister\nOr better, you're sellin' your niece to the weirdos, not the good ones\nKatt Williams said, \"Get you the truth,\" so I'ma get mines\nThe Embassy 'bout to get raided too, it's only a matter of time\nAyy, LeBron, keep the family away, hey, Curry, keep the family away\nTo anybody that embody the love for their kids, keep the family away\nThey lookin' at you too if you standin' by him, keep the family away\nI'm lookin' to shoot through any pervert that lives, keep the family safe\nDear baby girl\nI'm sorry that your father not active inside your world\nHe don't commit to much but his music, yeah, that's for sure\nHe a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs\nTry destroyin' families rather than takin' care of his own\nShould be teachin' you time tables or watchin' Frozen with you\nOr at your eleventh birthday singin' poems with you\nInstead, he be in Turks payin' for sex and poppin' Percs, examples that you don't deserve\nI wanna tell you that you're loved, you're brave, you're kind\nYou got a gift to change the world, and could change your father's mind\n'Cause our children is the future, but he lives inside confusion\nMoney's always been illusion, but that's the life he's used to\nHis father prolly didn't claim him neither\nHistory do repeats itself, sometimes it don't need a reason\nBut I would like to say it's not your fault that he's hidin' another child\nGive him grace, this the reason I made Mr. Morale\nSo our babies like you can cope later\nGive you some confidence to go through somethin', it's hope later\nI never wanna hear you chase a man 'cause it's feral behavior\nSittin' in the club with sugar daddies for validation\nYou need to know that love is eternity and trumps all pain\nI'll tell you who your father is, just play this song when it rains\nYes, he's a hitmaker, songwriter, superstar, right\nAnd a fuckin' deadbeat that should never say \"more life\"\nMeet the Grahams\nDear Aubrey\nI know you probably thinkin' I wanted to crash your party\nBut truthfully, I don't have a hatin' bone in my body\nThis supposed to be a good exhibition within the game\nBut you fucked up the moment you called out my family's name\nWhy you had to stoop so low to discredit some decent people?\nGuess integrity is lost when the metaphors doesn't reach you\nAnd I like to understand 'cause your house was never a home\nThirty-seven, but you showin' up as a seven-year-old\nYou got gamblin' problems, drinkin' problems, pill-poppin' and spendin' problems\nBad with money, whorehouse\nSolicitin' women problems, therapy's a lovely start\nBut I suggest some ayahuasca, strip the ego from the bottom\nI try to empathize with you 'cause I know that you ain't been through nothin'\nCrave entitlement, but wanna be liked so bad that it's puzzlin'\nNo dominance, let's recap moments when you didn't fit in\nNo secret handshakes with your friend\nNo culture cachet to binge, just disrespectin' your mother\nIdentity's on the fence, don't know which family will love ya\nThe skin that you livin' in is compromised in personas\nCan't channel your masculine even when standin' next to a woman\nYou a body shamer, you gon' hide them baby mamas, ain't ya?\nYou embarrassed of 'em, that's not right, that ain't how mama raised us\nTake that mask off, I wanna see what's under them achievements\nWhy believe you? You never gave us nothin' to believe in\n'Cause you lied about religious views, you lied about your surgery\nYou lied about your accent and your past tense, all is perjury\nYou lied about your ghostwriters, you lied about your crew members\nThey all pussy, you lied on 'em, I know they all got you in 'em\nYou lied about your son, you lied about your daughter, huh\nYou lied about them other kids that's out there hopin' that you come\nYou lied about the only artist that can offer you some help\nFuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself116Embed"

Lyrics\n\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI woke up this morning and figured I'd call you\nIn case I'm not here tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope\u2014 \nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it Section.80\nThe message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"\nWhat's crazy was I was hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I got to fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\u2026 Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit\u2026\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\n\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother\u2014nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.\"\n\"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we\u2014nigga, we right here, my nigga.\"\n\"Bring a nigga back a black!\"\n\"Nigga\u2014bruh\u2014nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

you, you, you)\nThat's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)\nAnd sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain\nIt's such a shame, they may call me crazy\nThey may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'\nBut homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)\nBlack don't crack, my nigga\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nBeen feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses\nYou never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it\nI'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon\nHeritage of a small village, pardon my residence\nCame from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide\nYou hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture\nYou're fuckin' evil\nI want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey\nYou vandalize my perception but can't take style from me\nAnd this is more than confession\nI mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion\nI'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it\nYou sabotage my community, makin' a killin'\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\nSee Kendrick

big gold chains full of rocks\nHow you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back\nBut now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block\nAll them say we doomed from the start cah we Black\nRemember this, every race start from the Black, jus 'member dat\n\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nI mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society\nThat's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me\nCurse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing\nThat I'ma be just another slave in my head\nInstitutionalized manipulation and lies\nReciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes\nYou hate me, don't you?\nI know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself\nJealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt\nWatchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out\nMuscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah\nBlack and successful, this Black man meant to be special\nKatzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?\nHow can I tell you I'm making a killin'?\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot\nI said they treat me like a slave cah me Black\nWoi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black\nAnd man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black\nImagine now, big gold chains full of rocks\nHow you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back\nBut now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block\nAll them say we doomed from the start cah we Black\nRemember this, every race start from the Black, go scream mother\n\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nWhen I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree\nThis plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred\nIt's genocism, it's grimy, little justification\nI'm African-American, I'm African\nI'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan\nI'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French\nBut fuck you \u2014 no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets\nI know you hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you\nI can tell 'cause your ways deceitful\nKnow I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle\nThinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him\nIt's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war\nTwo tribal armies that wanna build and destroy\nRemind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door\nBeefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score\nSo don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers\nOr tell Georgia State \"Marcus Garvey got all the answers\"\nOr try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day\nOr eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays\nOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements\nOr watch BET 'cause urban support is important\nSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\nWhen gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\nHypocrite!\n1.6KEmbed"

Somebody that's holdin' my checks\nJust to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?\nI read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered\nHow did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?\nThe type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'\nDrill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'\nI practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck\nAt 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged\nHow they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city\nWhat they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me\nWhat they see from me would trickle down generations in time\nWhat they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me\nI'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride\n'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more\nI'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness\nFear, whatever it is, both is distinctive\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nSearchin' for resolutions until somebody get back\nFear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth\nAnd I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse\nWithin fourteen tracks, carried out over wax\nWonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap\nDamn\n\nGod damn you, God damn me\nGod damn us, God damn we\nGod damn us all\n\nVerse 2 says, \"You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities\"\nSo until we come back to these commandments\nUntil you come back to these commandments\nWe gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse\nBecause He said He's gonna punish us\nThe so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians\nAre the true children of Israel\nWe are the Israelites, according to the Bible\nThe children of Israel\nHe's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience\nBecause we chose to follow other gods\nThat man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee\nSo, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you\nBecause He loves you, so that's why we get chastised\nThat's why we're in the position that we're in\nUntil we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments\nAnd do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us\nWe gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live\nHere, in today, in the United States of America\nI love you, family, and I pray for you\nGod bless you\nShalom178Embed"

How do you serve the question?\nSee, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world\nI don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world\nI don't love people enough to put my faith in man\nI put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band\nI understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around\nThis time I might put you down\nLast time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now\nMy feelings might go numb, you're dealin\u2019 with cold thumb\nI\u2019m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from\nPity parties and functions of you and yours\nA perfect world, you probably live another 24\nI can\u2019t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure\nI can't fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nMe, I wasn\u2019t taught to share, but care\nIn another life, I surely was there\nMe, I wasn't taught to share, but care\nI care, I care\nMaybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there\n\nNow, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive\nCold as December but never remember what winter did\nI wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid\nSeems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays\nSmiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there\nIndigenous disposition, feel like we belong here\nI know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back\nThe hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that\nSick venom in men and women overcome with pride\nA perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies\nPromises are broken and more resentment come alive\nRace barriers make inferior of you and I\nSee, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches\nI'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison\nI'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service\nJust to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world\nMe, I wasn't taught to share, but care\nIn another life, I surely was there\nMe, I wasn't taught to share, but care\nI care, I care\nMaybe I wasn't there (We saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there (I saw you first)\nMaybe I wasn't there170Embed"

best of they own opportunities?\nI see myself as a natural-born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin', I took the opportunities\nI worked at the m-most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI-I went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company (Right)\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I'm saying?\nI made myself a millionaire (Right), I made\u2014, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying?\nI made millions for the record companies (Mhm)\nI made millions for these movie companies (Mhm)\nNow I make millions for, for us (Mmm)\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in \"all good\u2014, all good things come to those that stay true\"\nRight\nYou know what I'm saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo, it's no problem, you know\nI mean, it's a problem, but I'm not finna let them know (Hmm)\nI'm finna go straight through\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh, threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance\nAnd not only me, but it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back\nAight, well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n\"We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down\"\nIn this country, a Black man only have like\nFive years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n'Cause once you turn thirty it's like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a Black man in this country\nAnd you don't wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don't believe me, you can look around\nYou don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers (Mhm)\nThat's crazy, because me, being one of your offsprings of the legacy you left behind\nI can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so, I want to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed, for real\nI don't think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it's gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain't gonna be no playing\nIt's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying?\nIt's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831 (Mhm), up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen (Mmm)\nThat's crazy, man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nA lot of people don't understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy\nI'ma push out or where it comes from\nTrip me out sometimes\nBecause it's spirits, we ain't even really rappin'\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us (Damn)\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt's actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world\nIt says:\n\u201cThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts, he's trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered\nEnding the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat's your perspective on that?\nPac? Pac? Pac?605Embed"

Only God could teleport this type of freedom\nGod, ah, my confession is yours\nBut, who am I if I don't go to war?\nThere's opportunity when livin' with loss\nI discover myself when I fall short\nRaise my hands to a fallen sky, I fantasize\nMe jumpin' planets immortalized, I correspond\nThree angels watchin' me all the time\nPut my children to sleep with a prayer, then close my eyes\nDefinition of peace\nTell me who gon' stop me? I come from love\nEstelle cover my heart, then open me up\nRemember when picked up a pen, lyrics that I can trust\nTimid soul, stare in the mirror, askin' where I was from often\nI know this type of power is gon' cost\nBut I live in circadian rhythms of a shooting star\nThe mannerisms of Raphael, I can heal or give you art\nBut the industry's cooked as I pick the carcass apart\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nYeah, somebody's lyin', I can see the vibes on Ak'\nEven he lookin' compromised, let's peel the layers back\nAin't no brownie points for beating your chest, harassin' Ant\nFuckin' with good people make good people go to bat\nConspiracies about Cash, dog? That's not even the leak\nFind the jewels like Kash Doll, I just need you to think\nAre you finally ready to play have-you-ever? \u2013 let's see\nHave you ever thought that OVO is workin' for me?\nFake bully, I hate bullies, you must be a terrible person\nEveryone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it\nCan't Toosie Slide up outta this one, it's just gon' resurface\nEvery dog gotta have its day, now live in your purpose\nIt was fun until you started to put money in the streets\nThen lost money 'cause they came back with no receipts\nI'm sorry that I live a boring life, I love peace\nBut war-ready if the world is ready to see you bleed, The Elohim, KTW\nKnow you can't sleep, these images trouble you\nKnow the wires in your circle should puzzle you\nIf you were street-smart, then you woulda caught that your entourage is only to hustle you\nA hundred niggas that you got on salary\nAnd twenty of 'em want you as a casualty\nAnd one of them is actually next to you\nAnd two of them is practically tired of your lifestyle\nJust don't got the audacity to tell you\nBut let me tell you some game 'cause I can see you, my lil' homie\nYou playin' dirty with propaganda, it blow up on ya\nYou're playin' nerdy with Zack Bia and Twitter bots\nBut your reality can't hide behind Wi-Fi\nYour lil' memes is losin' steam, they figured you out\nThe forced opinions is not convincin', y'all need a new route\nIt's time that you look around on who's around you\nBefore you figure that you're not alone, ask: \"What Mike would do?\"51Embed"

Nigga, I can name several\nSituations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'\nA baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?\nWhere was your antennas?\nWhere was the influence you speak of?\nYou preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her\nI fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure\u2014you ain't no leader!\nI never liked you, forever despise you\u2014I don't need ya!\nThe world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya\nNumbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication\nThought money would change you, made you more complacent\nFuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear\u2014\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nLoving you is complicated, loving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated, loving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated, loving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated, loving you is complicated\nLoving you is complicated, loving you is complicated\n\nLovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100\u00b0 proof\nI can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me\nYes, I hate you, too\n(Loving you ain't really complicated)\n\"Housekeeping, housekeeping\"\n(What I got to do to get to you?)\n\"\u00a1Abre la puerta! \u00a1Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!\"\n(To you)\n\"\u00a1Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!\"\n(Loving you ain't really complicated)\n\"\u00a1Disculpe!\"\n(What I got to do to get to you?)\n(To you)\n\nAnd you the reason why mom and them leavin'\nNo, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it\nI know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it\nYour trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it\nEveryone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out\nYou was deserted, where was your antennas again?\nWhere was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?\nYou ain\u2019t no brother, you ain\u2019t no disciple, you ain\u2019t no friend\nA friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother\nYou promised you\u2019d watch him before they shot him\nWhere was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches\nYou FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven\nYou even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit\nGuess you thought he'd recover well\nThird surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real\nThen he died, God himself will say, \"You fuckin' failed,\" you ain't try\n\n*Sniffling*\n\nI know your secrets, nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga\nI know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons, nigga\nI know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin', nigga\nY'all damn near beefin', I see it and you're the reason, nigga\nAnd if this bottle could talk *gulping*\nI cry myself to sleep, bitch, everything is your fault\nFaults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend\nBecause you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed\nI know your secrets, don't let me tell 'em to the world\nAbout that shit you thinkin' and that time you *gulping*, I'm 'bout to hurl\nI'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you\nYou just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof\nShould've killed yo' ass long time ago\nYou should've felt that black revolver blast a long time ago\nAnd if these mirrors could talk it'd say, \"You gotta go\"\nAnd if I told your secrets the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness450Embed"

Lyrics\nIt was always me versus the world\nUntil I found it's me versus me\nWhy, why, why, why?\nWhy, why, why, why?\nJust remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!\nWe gon' put it in reverse\n\nDarling, I told you many times\nAnd I am telling you once again\nJust to remind you, sweetheart\nThat my\u2014\n\nOh, Lamar\nHail Mary and marijuana, times is hard\nPray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark\nFellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star\nLife is one funny ma'fucker\nA true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him\nI might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep\nIntroverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep\nSee, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects\nThe object was to process and digest poverty's dialect\nAdaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot\nFederal policies raid buildings and drug professionals\nAnthony was the oldest of seven\nWell-respected, calm and collected\nLaughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack\nA four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her\nHis family history: pimpin' and bangin'\nHe was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'\nFifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces\nEven got some head from a smoker last weekend\nDodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie\nSmall-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him\nTen-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily\nSeen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies\nHad a couple of shooters, caught a murder case\nFingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it\nThat was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin\nHe beat the case and went back to hustlin'\nBird-shufflin', Anthony rang\nThe first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing\nThey say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots\nAnd hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks\nCrooked cops told Anthony he should kick it\nHe brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken\nSee, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot\nWith a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window\nHis name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes\nSouthside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome\nDrove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars\nThey had a son, hopin' that he'd see college\nHustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it\nCadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends\nThree-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket\n'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it\nStuck up the place before, back in '84\nThat's when affiliation was really at gears of war\nSo many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime\nIntelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's\nDucky was well-aware\nThey robbed the manager and shot a customer last year\nHe figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides\nFree chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits\nAnthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him\nIn fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention\nThat one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time\nReverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why\nYou take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments\nGive 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it\nTwenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again\nInside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits\nThen you start remindin' them about that chicken incident\nWhoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?\nBecause if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life\nWhile I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight\n*Gunshot*\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nThgifnug a ni eid dna rehtaf a tuohtiw pu werg I elihW\nEfil 'nivres eb dluoc gwaD poT ,ykcuD dellik ynohtnA fi esuaceB\nEcnedicnioc morf eb dluow reppar tsetaerg eht thguoht reveohW?\nTnedicni nekcihc taht tuoba meht 'nidnimer trats uoy nehT\nStifeneb rieht 'nipaer yeht erehw soiduts gnidrocer edisnI\nNiaga teem me' ekam uoy ,sregnarts emas meht ,retal sraey ytnewT\nTi htiw evil dna seciohc nwo rieht ekam nac yeht os luos a me' eviG\nStnemaciderp modnar ni me' tup dna sregnarts owt ekat uoY\nYhw uoy llet ll'I dna ,amrak doog dna tsefinam eht esreveR\nEmit a ta esruc eno ,sevil yeht fo htob degnahc noisiced eno tahT\nNoitnetta yaP\u2014\nErac tuB\n\u2014Tpecnoc etalucammi ,siht ekil eno ecnis retrauq eniacoC\nAND ym edisni ytlayor tog ,ytlayoL\n\u2014Tog I ,tog I ,tog I ,tog I\nSo, I was takin' a walk the other day\u2026213Embed"

realize life is perspective\nAnd my perspective may differ from yours\nI wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me\nAll my fans, all\u205fmy\u205fbeautiful\u205ffans\nAnyone who's ever\u205fgave me a\u205flisten, all my people\n\nI come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor\nRebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer\nBelt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence\nMake the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment\nResidue burned, mist of the inner-city\nMiscommunication to keep homi' detective busy\nNo protection is risky\nDesensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged\nGet used to hearin' arsenal rain\nAnalyze, risk your life, take the charge\nHomies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard\nThat's culture\nTwenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called\nSaid your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved\nI done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house\nGet out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed\nCar wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed\nA brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams\nThe culture\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\n(I want, I want, I want, I want)\nBut I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood\nLook what I done for you (Look what I done for you)\nLook what I done for you\n\nI said I do this for my culture\nTo let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover\nIn my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper\nHair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'\nFriends bipolar, grab you by your pockets\nNo option if you froze up, always play the offense\nNiggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work\nWorkin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork\nThat's the culture, point the finger, promote ya\nRemote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya\nThe streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me\nI wanna represent for us\nNew revolution was up and movin'\nI'm in Argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion\nWater in between us, another peer's been executed\nHistory repeats again\nMake amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it\nBut that's the culture, crack a bottle\nHard to deal with the pain when you're sober\nBy tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over\nThat's the problem\nOur foundation was trained to accept whatever follows\nDehumanized, insensitive\nScrutinize the way we live for you and I\nEnemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you\nIn the land where no equal is your equal\nNever say I ain't told ya, nah\nIn the land where hurt people hurt more people\nFuck callin' it culture\n(I want, I want, I want, I want)\nBut I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood\nLook what I done for you (Look what I done for you)\nLook what I done for you\n\nTake the drums out\n\nCelebrate new life when it come back around\nThe purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now\nSacrifice personal gain over everything\nJust to see the next generation better than ours\nI wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered\nTemptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures\nI felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry\nBut all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent\nFace your fears, always knew that I would make it here\nWhere the energy is magnified and persevered\nConsciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear\nEuphoria is glorified and made His\nReflectin' on my life and what I done\nPaid dues, made rules, change outta love\nThem same views made schools change curriculums\nBut didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun\nShould I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?\nShould I feel regret about the good that I was into?\nEverything is everything, this ain't coincidental\nI woke up that morning with more heart to give you\nAs I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence\nTo my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven\nTo my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven\nTo my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven\nTo my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings\nTo my fans, make sure you make them investments\nAnd to the killer that sped up my demise\nI forgive you, just know your soul's in question\nI seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed\nAnd though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved\nI completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave\nBut fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased\nI can't stress how I love y'all\nI don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all\nThe memories recollect just because y'all\nCelebrate me with respect\nThe unity we protect is above all\nAnd Sam, I'll be watchin' over you\nMake sure my kids watch all my interviews\nMake sure you live out our dreams we produced\nKeep that genius in your brain on the move\nAnd to my neighborhood, let the good prevail\nMake sure them babies and the leaders outta jail\nLook for salvation when troubles get real\n'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself\nAnd I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed\nY'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel\nAnd though my physical won't reap the benefits\nThe energy that carry on emits still\nI want you201Embed"

Shit, you know we from Chicago, you know that's what we do\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\nSing my song, it's all for you\n\n\"If I don't hear from you by tomorrow, I hope you come back and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? Talk to you later, bye.\"\n(*Sound of a cassette tape being stopped and fast forwarded*)181Embed"

Diaries Lyrics\nHeart plays in ways the mind can't figure out\nHeart plays in ways the mind can't\u2014\nHeart plays in ways the mind can't figure out\nThis is how we conceptualize human beings\n\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nMotorola pager, off-white Guess jacket\nBlue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits\n'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest\nBig social, big personality, vocal\nPlayed the underground verbatim and stayed local\nMy auntie is a man now\nI watch him and his girl hold their hands down\nTip of the avenues under street lights made his\nThinking, \"I want me a bad bitch when I get big\"\nThey hug on the corner like California King\nCold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road\nSee, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado\nScratching the likes from lotto\nHoping that she pull up tomorrow\nSo I can hang out in the front seat\nSix-by-nines keeping the music up under me\nMy auntie is a man now\nAsked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much\nAnd at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much\nShe said, \"Ain't no tellin'\nNiggas always been jealous because he had more women\nMore money and more attention made more envy\nCalling him anything but broke was less offending\"\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nBack when it was comedic relief to say, \"Faggot\"\n\"Faggot, faggot, faggot,\" we ain't know no better\nElementary kids with no filter, however\nMy auntie became a man and I took pride in it\nShe wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference\nThat's what I told my friends in second grade\nShe picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face\nThey couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed\nWe pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing\nMy auntie is a man now, what a relationship\nI grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit\nHe gave me some cash then gave me some game\nCherry freshener on the dash, I never complained\nShe even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade\nThe first person I seen write a rap\nThat's when my life had changed\nHouse full of demo, smoke stuck on the window\nCameras on the microphone, all women and men know\nMy auntie was a man now, we cool with it\nThe history had trickled down and made us ign'ant\nMy favorite cousin said he's returning the favor\nAnd following my auntie with the same behavior\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nHe's more confident to live his plan now (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nBut the family in disbelief this time (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nConvincing themselves, \"He ain't living discreet, he's fine\" (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nThey said they never seen it in him, but I seen it (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nThe Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nHe built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over\nHe didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\"Faggot, faggot, faggot,\" we ain't know no better\nMiddle school kids with no filter, however\nI had to be very mindful of my good cousin\nI knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nI mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further\nChanged his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain\nLiving his truth even if it meant see a surgeon\nWe didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant\nWasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive\nBut I recall we both had a sick sense of humor\nMade raw, but time changes all\n\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nRemember church, Easter Sunday?\nI sat in the pew, you had stronger faith\nMore spiritual when these dudes were living life straight\nWhich I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same\nHe said my cousin was going through some things\nHe promised the world we living in was an act on abomination\nAnd Demetrius was to blame\nI knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman\nWondering if God still call you a decent man\nStill, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint\nUntil he singled you out to prove his point, saying\n\"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now\nChurch, his auntie is a man now,\" it hurt\nYou the most 'cause your belief was close to his words\nForcing me to stand now\nI said, \"Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?\nThe laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?\nI recognize the study she was taught since birth\nBut that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved\"\nThe building was thinking out loud, bad angel\nThat's when you looked at me and smiled, said, \"Thank you\"\nThe day I chose humanity over religion\nThe family got closer, it was all forgiven\nI said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better\nMistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different\nSee, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound\nIf ever they was pronounced without any intentions\nThe very second you challenged the shit I was kicking\nReminded me about a show I did out the city\nThat time I brung a fan on stage to rap\nBut disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me\nYou said, \"Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction\nTo truly understand love, switch position\n'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together\nBut only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'\"48Embed"

It's entirely stressful upon my brain\nYou hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change\nWhen violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain\nThe silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms\nSome grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose\nThe streets sure to release the worst side of my best\nDon't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city\nMass hallucination, baby\nIll education, baby\nWant to reconnect with your elations?\nThis is your station, baby144Embed"

Told you I was Christian, but just not today\nI transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape\nMy mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife\nStarin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night\nLoved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover\nTransformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober\n\nI wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\nOoh, I wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\n\nI remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted\nOnly child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas\nFamily ties, they accused my cousin, \"Did he touch you, Kendrick?\"\nNever lied, but no one believed me when I said \"He didn't\"\nFrozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself\nI started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself\nTalked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself\nHe has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help\nCongratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy\nWater watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me\nSpirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me\n\"Did he touch you?\" I said \"No\" again, still they didn't believe me\nMother's brother said he got revenge for my mother\u2019s face\nBlack and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase\n'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over\nBlame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nI wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\nOoh, I wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\n\nI was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind\nI need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined\nI did it sober sittin' with myself, I went through all emotions\nNo dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer\nIntoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention\nInsecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women\nWhitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen\nAskin' God, \"Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?\"\nBroke me down, she looked me in my eyes, \"Is there an addiction?\"\nI said \"No,\" but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it\nPure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me\nGave me a number, said she recommended some therapy\nI asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her \"No\"\nI never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic\nTold me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection\nThough it never happened, she wouldn't agree\nNow I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced\nAmplified as I write this song, I shiver 'cause I'm nervous\nI was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years\nNothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel\nI made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood\nBut Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could\nAll those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked\nI pray our children don't inherit me and feelings I attract\nA conversation not bein' addressed in Black families\nThe devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity\nThey raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters\nThen they made us watch, then made us rape each other\nPsychotic torture between our lives, we ain't recovered\nStill livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance\nEvery other brother has been compromised\nI know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused\nI see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos\nSo listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move\nLearn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school\nHis anger grows deep in misogyny\nThis is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active\nSo I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made\nSo I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame\nSo I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain\nI hope Hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain\nSo I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all\nSo I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God\nSo I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred\nAs I set free all you abusers, this is transformation\nI wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\nOoh, I wish I was somebody\nAnybody but myself\n\nYou did it, I'm proud of you\nYou broke a generational curse\nSay \"Thank you, dad\"\nThank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother\nMr. Morale\n\nBefore I go in fast asleep, love me for me\nI bare my soul and now we're free56Embed"

From the front to the back\nI'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react\nAh, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto\nWhen I was seventeen with the .38 special\nMaybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real\nMaybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel\nMaybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway\nDon't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway\nI can be your advocate\nI can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is162Embed"

evil dead zombies\nWith batteries to the head\nThe flattery of watchin' my stock rise\nThe salary, the compensation tripled my cock size\nI run through these stop signs with no brake fluid\nJust premium gas, do it for dolo\nCrash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo\nBlack excellence, pessimist, die countin' my coin\nHope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better\nI blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather\nForecastin' my future, this is the future\nThe mastermind, until my next album, more power to you\n*Gunshot*\n\nCome on, come on,

I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said \"You know what, girl? You crazy.\" Then she asked me what he said...\n(What did the Asian say?) \"A peace of mind\"\nThat's what the Asian said\u2014I need a divine\nIntervention was his religion and I was surprised\nHim believing in Buddha, me believing in God\nAsked him what are you doing, he said \"taking my time\nMeditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try\nSee you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself\nWorried about your career, you ever think of your health?\"\n(What did the Indian say?) \"A piece of land\"\nThat's what the Indian said\u2014I needed the man\nTelling me longevity is in the dirt\nShould buy some property first\nShould profit a better dollar with generational perks\nEquity at his best, really, you should invest\nThese tangible things expire, don't you expect\nIncome with so much outcome and yes\nLook at my heritage, we blessed\n(Now, what the black man say?) \"A piece of pussy\"\nThat's what the black man said I needed to push me\nTo the limit, to satisfy my hunger\nWe do it all for a woman from haircut to a war\nWe like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach\nWhat you saying to me?\nHe said, \"Nigga, come back to reality for a week\"\nPussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night\nI wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\n(What the white man say?) A piece of mine's\nThat's what the white man wanted when I rhyme\nTelling me that he selling me just for $10.99\nIf I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine\nWhat if I compromise? He said it don't even matter\nYou make a million or more, you living better than average\nYou losing your core following, gaining it all\nHe put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw\nHit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw\nPut myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars\n\"Look at what you accomplishing\"; what he said to the boy\n\"I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore\nYour profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market\nIf you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet\nA lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet\nYour world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece\"\nI holler, \"What you do? What you say?\"\nI shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today\nI holler, \"What you do? What you say?\"\nI shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today\n\nWhat the black man say?\nTell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die\nTell 'em we don't die, we multiply\nTell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die\nTell 'em we don't die, we multiply\nTell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die\nTell 'em we don't die, we multiply\nTell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die\nTell 'em we don't die, we multiply435Embed"

Lyrics\nSomebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor\nJumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal\nDrowned inside the lake outside, away you flow\nAnd that means the world to me\nAnd that means the world to me\nAnd that means the world to me\nAnd that means the world to me\nSomebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor\nJumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal\nDrowned inside the lake outside, away you flow\nAnd this I know\nI got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my drum\nName in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk\nTaaka vodka on the top of my binocular, I'm drunk\nHow come I can make them popular, pop em' when I want\nSee I'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety\nFuckin' up the system, I ain't fuckin' with society\nJustice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me\nSo I justify his name on obituary\nWhy you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?\nOnce upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God\nNow I'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all I got\nNow I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked\nWatch you when you walk inside your house\nYou threw your briefcase all on the couch\nI plan on creeping through your fuckin' door and blowin' out\nEvery piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms\nCut on the engine, then sped off in the rain, I'm gone\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nSomebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor\nJumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal\nDrowned inside the lake outside, away you flow\nAnd that means the world to me\nAnd that means the world to me\nAnd that means the world to me\nAnd that means the world to me\nHe drove alone, with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle\nLit off Henny, I'm tryna dismantle\nThese wicked ways, I've engaged in such a gamble\n'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait\nThat's a bit ambitious maybe I'm trippin'\nMaybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension\nNot to mention when I close my eyes I see the distance\nIt's such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night\nI watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall\nStudied the son of God and still don't recognize my flaws\nI guess I'm lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful\nI pray my experience helps you\nAs for me I'm tryna sort it out\nSearching for loopholes in my bruised soul\nBut who knows?\nI just need a little space to breathe\nI know perception is key, so I am king\nThe other side has never mortified my mortal mind\nThe borderline between insanity is Father Time\nI fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind\nI know that I'm intelligent, my confidence just died\nCarpe diem, seize the day, I can't compromise\nA tapeworm couldn't cure this gluttonous appetite\nA couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify\nBut couldn't fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice\nI'm passin' lives on the daily, maybe I'm losing faith\nGenocism and capitalism just made me hate\nCorrectionals and these private prisons gave me a date\nProfessional dream killers reason why I'm awake\nI'm sleepwalkin', I'm street stalkin', I'm outta place\nReinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes\nBefore I blink, do I see me before them pearly gates?\nOr this is just a mirage or a facade\nWait55Embed"

You looked at me and said, \"Baby, dry your eyes\nDepend on me as your relief, let your anger be mine\"\nWe was locked in ever since then\nSo territorial, even took me 'way from my friends, hmm, hmm (Gah, gah, gah)\n\nScared of forever, you know nothin' else is gon' pass\nI just gotta let you know, woah\nWhenever you want me, you got me 'til the end of time\nOoh, just gotta let you know\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nSaid you gon' see other people if I didn't grow with you\nWasn't no more holdin' them pistols in front of stores with you\nYou want reality, not tragedy, for sure, I get you\nTo tell the truth, I been pretty used to what open-minded people do\nIn 2014, I went to Africa, baby, you was my passenger\nMy eyes and ears for all the years the neighborhood had baffled us\nOf course I had to wrap it up, I didn't fully trust you\nFabrication, I disgust you, then you blocked me, I said, \"Fuck you\"\n\nNigga, what?\nI gave you life, I breathe the motherfuckin' charisma in this bitch\nI bring the blessings, I gave you power\nNigga, I bring the rainfall, I gave you hustle\nThen fall right back in love the very moment that I touch you (Gah, gah, gah)\n\nScared of forever, you know nothin' else is gon' pass\nI just gotta let you know\nWhenever you want me, you got me 'til the end of time\nOoh, just gotta let you know\n\nYou were spontaneous, firecracker, plus our love is dangerous\nLife of passion, laughin' at you lose your temper, slightly crashin'\nDumb enough to ill reaction, ain't no disrespect\nHighly sensitive, possessed, saw potential, even when it's tragic\nSo jealous, hate it when I hit the club to get some bitches\nWrote 'em off, rather see me hit the church and get religious\nWho you foolin'? I know what you doin', you my contradiction\n'Member when you caught that body and still wiggled through that sentence?\nLoved you more, when you flip and lose your shit, I hugged you more\nIt's sexy to me, cuss they ass out and hold that grudge some more\nDown bitch, I know your favorite movie, is it Notebook?\nSo good, if they all sub me, get 'em all booked\nMy baby boo, you either heal niggas or you kill niggas\nBoth is true, it take some tough skin just to deal with you\nLogical explanation don't exist, flippin' pages\nChapter after chapter, probably remarry and head to Vegas\nBitches gettin' marked out, they can't erase our history\nThey margins ain't big enough, they all led by bigotry\nMy woman and my right hand, my saint and my sin\nAin't no bitch like my bitch 'cause that bitch been my pen\nGloria, I wanna take you to euphoria\nBitches want, but they ain't strong enough\nI heard they talking, we notorious\nIf someone talking on me\nI see you, you see me\nBoth see what we want, oh, oh\nI see you, you see me\nBoth see what we want8Embed"

That's mission impossible\nSo I never believed the type of performance that I could do\nI wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got\nI was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton\nThank God\n(Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly)80Embed"

All right, I don\u2019t believe in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever. I try not to obey them at anytime. That's what I believe in not believing in.\"\n\"So what keeps you alive?\"\n\"Four big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds. And, uh, I don\u2019t - what keeps me alive, shit. Music, I have to listen to music all day long. I'd say that keeps me going. I\u2019m a pretty dark person, I\u2019ve thought about ending it a million times. And I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing.\"\nThank you\n\nSitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go\nRight now, freestyle or write down, whatever\nIt still'll come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts\nAnd Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect\nI ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses\nYou should either hear me now or go deaf\nOr end up dead, die trying and know death\nMight end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath\nFuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect, nigga\nI mean that from the bottom of my heart\nYou see my art is all I have\nAnd victory tastes sweet, even when the enemy can throw salt\nStill knock them out the park like a fucking tow car\nLet bygones be bygones, but where I'm from\nWe buy guns and more guns to give to the young\nI'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga\nInside the system all you envision is trap niggas\nMy uncle doing life inside prison; he wasn't wrapped too tight\nHe told me \"Rap about life, not rap niggas\"\nThat's why I'm shaking my head when you rap-dissin'\nMy stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching\nI start evaluatin' that my final intuition\nIs that you wishin' to come up or just come up\nWe used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse\nNiggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre\nAnd this is Comp-ton, lions in the land of the triumph\nWrap-Saran our defiance, ban our alliance\nPut burners in the hands of the black man\nOne hood with 20 four-fours like a cloned Kobe Bryant\nYou probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am\nYou probably even listened to \"Faith,\" and think I know Zion\nBut really I'm just caught in the loop, of understanding the truth\nBecause it seem like it's always clashing with science\nI got a big fear of flying\nMy future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice\nI ain't lying\nI swear to God, half of y'all just don't know Kendrick\nThe school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance\nYou walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eye witness\nYou just mind your business\nYou just turn your head, kneel down and then tie your tennis\nIt's kind of scary, ain't it?\nYou can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous\nJust let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?\n'Cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you and you hate it\nSo much you probably had your burner tucked at graduation\nSo if you see him on 'em bleachers then you kill him\nFacing 25 to life with a murder charge\nYour enemies was the prey and now you pray to God\nI pray these bars get farther than Compton\nAnd if our record never break, I still won\u2019t break my promise\nI promise to keep it honest\nSecret society, all we ask is trust\nAnd all we lack is communication like service sucks\nThe people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come\nAnd I'm like, \"The Kendrick Lamar OD in less than a month, all right?\"\nGotta keep it pushing\nCan't let the government tell me how my future looking\nI'm on Rosecrans and Central trying to duck the central bookins'\nIf the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bookin'\nNever will I surrender\nI been a warrior when I came out my mom's placenta\nIn the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter\nHow splendid, I guess my project had did it\nGot all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different\nThey said seven tracks, I said 15\nCalled it an EP, they said I\u2019m trippin'\nBut little did they know, I\u2019m tryna' change the rules\nThat we\u2019ve been confined to, so the corporate won\u2019t make decisions\nUppity bitches handling business\nKilling our dreams, stealing our vision\nOut in Haiti, adolescents barely have a home\nIn LA everybody think they fucking on\nHop on Twitter, perpetrate we doing big shit\nWho we hanging with and bragging about the iPhone\nI swear to God most of y'all cats just don\u2019t know Kendrick\nYou barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended\nAin\u2019t doing this for my health, I\u2019m tryna' purchase my momma dem' Benzes\nOccupying my time with riches, justifying my time ambitions\nJust to coincide, just to go inside, plus we idolize why we living\nLook, the mastermind took the master's mind\nJust the perfect time, just to master mine\nJust to match the grind with precision\nLook, the mastermind took - (cough)\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nWe would like to call this an appreciation tape for those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP. For this is the Kendrick Lamar OD. Because of you we are Overly Dedicated\n52Embed"

(What you gon' do?)\nLift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)\nOr let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)\nPeace to fashion police, I wear my heart\nOn my sleeve, let the runway start\nYou know the miserable do love company\nWhat do you want from me and my scars?\nEverybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence\nHow many times my potential was anonymous?\nHow many times the city making me promises?\nSo I promise this\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nI love myself\n(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs), I love myself\n(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind), I love myself\n(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide), I love my, self\n(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)\n\nThey wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street\nAnd a gun in the hood, and a mob of police\nAnd a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend\nAnd a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene, yup\nThese days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation\nI duck these cold faces, post up \"fi-fie-fo-fum\" basis\nDreams of reality's peace (Ayy, ayy)\nBlow steam in the face of the beast\nThe sky could fall down, the wind could cry now\nThe strong in me, I still smile\nI love myself\n(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs), I love myself\n(But it can do what it want, whenever it want, I don't mind), I love myself\n(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide), I love my, self\n(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)\nWalk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)\nDown, down, valley deep (Down, down valley deep, I love myself)\nFi-fie-fo-fum (Fi-fie-fo-fum, I love myself)\nMy heart undone (My heart undone, I love myself)\n\nThe world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs (I love myself)\nBut it can do what it want, whenever it want, I don't mind (I love myself)\nHe said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide (I love my, self)\nOne day at a time, sun gon' shine (Hold up)\n\nI went to war last night\nWith an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic\nI'ma do it 'til I get it right\nI went to war last night\nI've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent\nDuckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message\nI could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave\nFrom a negative and letting them annihilate me\nAnd it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed\nFinna run into a building, lay my body in the street\nKeep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free\nGive my story to the children and a lesson they can read\nAnd the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen\nSeen enough, make a motherfucker scream, \"I love myself\"\nI lost my head\nI must've misread what the good book said\nOh, woes keep me, it's a jungle inside\nGive myself again 'til the well runs dry (I)\n69Embed"

Pumper, stomach turnin', I get up and proceeded to write somethin'\nAb-Soul in the corner mumblin' raps, fumblin' packs of Black & Milds\nCrumblin' kush 'til he cracked a smile\nHis words legendary, wishin' I could rhyme like him\nStudied his style to define my pen\nThat was back when the only goal was to get Jay Rock through the door\nWarner Brother Records, hope Naim Ali would let us know\nWas excited just to go to them label meetings\nWasn't my record deal, but still, I couldn't beli\u0435ve it\nMe and Rock inside th\u0435 booth hibernatin'\nIt was simple math, if he made it, that mean I made it\nEverything I had was for the team, I remained patient\nGrindin' with my brothers, it was us against them, no one above us, bless our hearts\n\nUse your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax your mind)\nIf you got time, then I got time (Yeah, yeah)\nFree your thoughts and watch them fly\nUse your heart and not your eyes (Mm-hmm)\n\nMy nigga Dave had a champagne Acura\nA bunch of instrumentals I freestyled in the passenger\nThat nigga wore several hats, a producer, a manager, director, and DJ\nA hothead squabblin', Bloods, Pirus, and Keeways\nFor this little thing of ours we called TDE\nI watched you take some penitentiary chances to say the least\nRemember in the county building with MixedByAli\nWe tried to freak the system just to make a couple ends meet\nThat's my nigga for shit sure\nHe brought Q over, but Q didn't rap, but he learned from our inspo\nWe split Louisiana chicken riverboat specials\nSleepin' next to 02R consoles to be our refuge\nHe was homeless and I left home\nQ said, \"Dot, you won't be slept on, you the nigga to bet on\" (Use your h\u2014)\nTop had given us dominion in the home he lived in\nHopin' that we see some millions, God bless our hearts\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nUse your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax your mind)\nIf you got time, then I got time (Yeah, yeah)\nFree your thoughts and watch them fly\nUse your heart and not your eyes\n\nPunch played Phil Jackson in my early practices\nStrategies on how to be great amongst the averages\nI picked his brain on what was ordained, highly collaborative\nRET pushed the label the same, amongst the savages\nMoose kept my name in the function that he would run in\nTEEZ kept the vultures away from me that was comin'\nSounwave let me borrow his clothes for shows as a hype man\nTo cook up in this room 'til the night ends\nTime flies, I'm carryin' debates of a top five\nBuryin' my opps and allies\nBut I'd done a half job communicatin' feelings of being stagnant\nLife was gettin' bigger than just rappin'\nThe business, what I was lackin'\nTop used to record me back when it was poor me\nAnd now we at the round table for what assures me\nI guess my motivation was the yearnin' for independence\nPoured everything I had left in the family business\nNow it's about Kendrick, I wanna evolve, place my skillset as a Black exec'\nI jog my memory, knowin' Black Hippy didn't work 'cause of me\nCreatively, I moved on with new concepts in reach\nTop, remember all them sessions we would strategize\nTo hit the streets, then come back, record three records? Ah\nTo tell the truth, it fucked me up when D-Man passed\nThe motive was the condolences, but the pride crashed\nI had to bypass old mythologies I had\nPut my heart on display like it was an iMac\nTo all my young niggas, let me be the demonstration\nHow to conduct differences with a healthy conversation\nIf that's your family, then handle it as such\nDon't let the socials gas you up or let emotions be your crutch\nPick up the phone and bust it up before the history is lost\nHand-to-handshake is good when you have a heart-to-heart\nUse your heart and not your eyes (Baby, just relax your mind)\nIf you got time and I got time (Yeah, yeah)\nFree your thoughts and watch them fly\nUse your heart and not your eyes (Mm-hmm)11Embed"

Then tell me why you constant stressing\nOn how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga\nI function with you and you flaunt your pistol\nEvery second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo\nWhere so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing\nWho baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend\nThat shit is mad depressing, bringing me down\nSpeak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid\nRather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style\nOr his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off\n'Cause every time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God\nShut the fuck up... scary ass\nEvery time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say\n\nUh, I'm tryna learn something new\nI'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star\nI'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa\nStudying art... now paint that picture\nLife behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?\nI murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?\nSee what I was taught, family is all I need\nBut indeed them too can run me right up a tree\nConstantly talking shit 'bout the next relative\nWanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in\nEver since grandma died, everyone parted ways\nArgue on holidays, left my uncle in prison\nFor 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms\nYeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come\nCome to my house just to yap about your own people\nDang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins\nI would prolly cut y'all off too, yep\n'Cause everytime y'all come around\nY'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up\nKeep it running, Ali\nEvery time you come around\nYou be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-bla\nHe say, she say\n\nSo tell 'em, \"Shut the fuck up!\"\nTell 'em, \"Shut the fuck up!\"\nYeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd\nYou turnt down, you thirsty\nTell 'em \"Shut the fuck up!\"\nTell 'em \"Shut the fuck up!\"\nYeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd\nYou turnt down, you thirsty\nYou thirsty, you boo-boo\nYou T, you turnt down\nYou boo-boo, you T'd\nYou boo-boo, you turnt down\nYou thirsty, you T'd\nYou boo-boo, you turnt down\nYou boo-boo, you T'd\nYou turnt down, you weak\nYou weak, yo\u2019 bitch weak\nYo- (laughs)\nYou boo-boo, you T (laughs)\nKeep all that\n\nWhat is HiiiPoWeR?\nHiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live\nSee it\u2019s known today that the human race is nothing\nNo morals, no standards\nWhat we\u2019re about to do is raise the level of expectations\nNo, you don\u2019t have to have a lot of money\nYou don\u2019t have to be rich\nBut you will be rich in mind and spirit\nSome say it\u2019s as big as a crew, some say it\u2019s as big as a gang\nHiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it\u2019s as big as a religion76Embed"

Why you couldn't?\nWhy you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious\nThe moment that we first started?\nWhy you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time?\nWhy you let me use yours 'cause I don't got mines?\nWhy you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up\nAnd when niggas holla, \"What's up?\" you give a dry response?\nWhy you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?\nWhy you always buy me something when you going shopping?\nWhy you tell me that you love me?\nWhy you always thinking of me?\nWant my company rather than going club hopping?\nWhy you treating my momma like she your momma too?\nWhy you making promises that you'll forever do?\nWhatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family\nThese are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you\" (Sometimes)\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nWe hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\nHurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\nHurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\nHurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\n\nSometimes I, sometimes I feel we share\nNothing in common, it ain't fair\nBut where do we seem to fall\nWhere do we seem to fall\nTender love and care, once upon a time\nOnce upon a time, we was there\n\nAnd so she said \"Why you gotta be so mean to me?\nWhy you don't know what you mean to me?\nWhy you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed\nOut in public curse me out and make a scenery?\nWhy you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?\nWhy text messages popping up saying, \"Hi, Daddy\"?\nWhy you treat me like I'm nothing? Why you always at a function?\nI be wanting to go out but you don\u2019t ever ask me\nWhy you slip and say her name when we having sex?\nWhy you always assuming that I still like my ex?\nEvery time we get into it, I'm the one that's feeling stupid\nYou don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's ya favorite threat\nWhy you never know how it feel to be lonely?\nWhy I feel I'm the last option after ya homies?\nWhy you always gotta know that I will never let you go\nEven though you get violent and put your hands on me?\"\nSometimes\nWe hurt people that love us, love people that\nHurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\nHurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\nHurt people that love us, love people that hurt us\n\nSometimes I, sometimes I feel we share\nNothing in common, it ain't fair\nBut where do we seem to fall\nWhere do we seem to fall\nTender love and care, once upon a time\nOnce upon a time, we was there\n\nShe says she loves me\nShe says she loves me\nSo she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone\nBut she's beautiful\nLike, sometimes, when I have things on my mind, she's the perfect person to listen\nAnd she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue\nShe says she loves me\nLike when I wake up in the morning, she's sitting on the edge of the bed with a plate of food, wanting to feed me\nShe says she needs me\nShe says she loves me\nOr like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she's standing there with the towel, wanting to, wanting to dry me off\nShe says, she says she loves me\nSo instead of admitting that she has made another mistake\nShe says she loves me... and I don't know about love91Embed"

Uh-huh\nYou see this game we play come from, uncles that raised me in Compton\nAsk me what I have accomplished, I don't know, I don't have conscience\nI just load up and start dumping on enemies I'm headhunting\nNo sympathy, ain't no love, when you in these streets, just get something\nProtect your neck 'cause they coming for set respect, split your onion\nThen chop your deck, your head tumbling like gymnastics (Ooh...)\n'Cause ignorance is bliss\n\nNow everybody put your hands up high\nIf you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nThis the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far\nAnd I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all\nWe all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off\nUntil the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off\nThen peel off in a hoopty\nCome back and make these niggas wanna shoot me\n\nAnd they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me\nIndubitably, I'm too street\u2014indubitably, I'ma do me\nBetter than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak\nBut just give me two weeks and I'm good\nI'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm\nMake Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent\nNo tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish\nNot only from the rap game\u2014I'm including the planet\nCats so watered-down, clowns can sink Titanic\nTie titanium around they neck and watch 'em panic\nGive me respect, dammit, or get damaged\nDie young, corpse identified by your parents\nApparently, you a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint\nBut I won't share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff\nStop it, I'm hearin' the comments\nThe critics are calling me conscious\nBut truthfully, every shooter be calling me Compton\nSo truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?\nProves... that ignorance is bliss\nNow everybody put your hands up high\nIf you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high\n\nAnd this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far\nAnd I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all\nThis my world, I grab the universe then play kickball\nAnd they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard\n\nI'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call Ghostbusters\n'Cause you busters are Casper when I go off\nI show up to show out and show off\nYou a hundred percent behind me\nAnd if you are, then wreck your car\nThen walk up to my crime scene\nI remember bein' seventeen, wishin' someone would sign me\nNow the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me\nBackin' down bargains, backin' down bitches\nWe gon' flip her\nOnce she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her\n'Cause ignorance is bliss\n\nAnd Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats\nI bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak85Embed"

Designed to make you think\nRaces and faces embracin' my conscience in letter form\nHow gracious was I speakin' on changes once outside the norm?\nThe person responsible, my creator\nHe never conformed or used hatred to form mass retaliation\nWatch him perform with conviction\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand souls left they homes to listen\nI gather his thoughts in abundance made to complete the mission\nHis life became heroic, then tables turned\nMy creator stripped from being a poet because he yearned\nOther women, infidelity stricken, I can't say he was perfect\nIt made me nervous, they tear him down and forget me\nI prayed that I survived in the midst of the controversy\nHow many lives will fall on deaf ears if I'm not worthy?\nI won't justify his personal problems, that's not my job\nI was only born to make sure your children can play outside\nAnd I imagine the other demons, he hid before he died\nIf they came to surface, this dream probably won't be alive because of you\n\nI was born in paranoia, it's poison for us\nWe can't create with joyous ambition, we're out of luck\nThe critics formed a new coalition and huddled up\nThe non-creators are now elated and out of touch\nWhy can't you gladly appreciate the influence we give?\nStop starin' at me disgusted, my substance made sure you'd lived\nYou want the head of the messenger and the history from him\nWhich eventually takes away from the good you accustom\nThink of a life without the likes of imagination that's prosperin'\nThe bodies that you consider genius, you like to box 'em in\nThe great debaters and thinkers, they gave you a voice\nWhy can't you prosecute the crimes and not the thoughts I employ?\nBecause your better judgement will always look down on me\nBut if I recollect how we connect, you'll account on me\nI got a theory that most of y'all won't allow to see\nIt goes like this, talent doesn't choose morality\nSee, if Daniel Hale was a killer, would you not want a heart?\nIf Carl Benz was a racist, would you stop driving cars?\nI can't help we jump in these bodies and you called them a God\nJust know the Earth is just a rock without the voices of art, sincerely yours18Embed"

Lyrics\nCome here, girl\nOh, you want me to touch you right there?\nOh, like a little lamb, play in your hair\nOh, you want it? Oh, you want it right now\nLike that? I got you, baby\nAll on you, baby\nPush it back on daddy\nPush it back on daddy, baby\n\nI seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory, life no\u2014\nI seen it vividly, jogging my brain memory\nLife no longer infinity, this was the final calling\nNo birds chirping or flying, no dogs barking\nWe all nervous and crying, moving in caution\nIn disbeliefs our belief's the reason for all this\nThe tallest building plummet, cracking, and crumbling\nThe ground is shaking, swallowing young woman\nWith a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction\nThe smell is disgusting, the heat is unbearable\nPreachers touching on boys, run for cover, the paranoid\nRapists and murderers hurdle alleys\nValleys and high places turn into dust\nFamous screaming in agony\nAtheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky\nTrains jumping off the track, mothers yelling \"He's alive!\"\nBackpedaling Christians settling for forgiveness\nEvidence all around us the town is covered in fishes\nOcean water dried out, fire burning more tides out\nTabernacle and city capital turned inside out\nPublic bathroom, college classroom's been deserted\nAnother trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it\n(It's happening) No more running from world wars\n(It's happening) No more discriminating the poor\n(It's happening) No more bad bitches and real niggas\nWishing for green and gold, the last taste of allure\nI swore I seen it vividly\nA moniker of war from Heaven that play the symphony\nThunder like number four, then I heard\n\"What have you did for me?\"\nI fell to my knees, pulled out my resume\nThat dated back to June 17th, 1987\nMy paperwork was like a receipt\nI was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment\nBut confident I had glory in all my past endeavors\nClose my eyes, pray to God that I live forever\nDark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home\nSome of us never did wrong but still went to Hell\nGeez Louise, I thought you said that I excel\nI made To Pimp a Butterfly for you\nTold me to use my vocals to save mankind for you\nSay I didn't try for you, say I didn't ride for you\nI tithed for you, I pushed the club to the side for you\nWho love you like I love you?\nCrucifix, tell me you can fix anytime I need\nAmistad, chain evidence in my diary\nNever would you lie to me\nAlways camaraderie, I can see, our days been numbered\nRevelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet\nAll man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse\nI guess I'm running in place trying to make it to church\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $115You might also like\nYoung nigga, act an ass\nYoung nigga, act a fool\nYoung nigga, get yo' cash\nYoung nigga, do what it do\nYoung nigga go, young nigga go\nYoung nigga go, young nigga go\nWhatever makes all of you happy in this bitch\nJust take it all back before the light switch64Embed"
