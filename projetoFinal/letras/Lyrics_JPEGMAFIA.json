comfort from me, I needed too much help\nI can't do one hour a week, I think I need more help\nI don't think I need no more fixin', I'll just heal myself\nWho's gonna be there when you low, bitch, you or somebody else?\nMy actions got way too active, I don't want no more help\nOne hour a week ain't enough for me, I think I need a friend\nEveryone that I ever dated deserves better ****\nI could have wrote this when I'm faded, but alcohol gives you a lens\nWhen I'm speaking my mind, I'm on demonic time\nI got family and fences to mend\nEvery argument comes with a cost, every dub ends up in a loss\nGotta keep the fa\u00e7ade of a boss, every picture developed is tossed\nI know bitches that I'll never talk to, I got exes I'm still fuckin' raw\nI been stuck in a car with the child-lock, tryna break out and answer the call\nCan you hear it?\nActual love, actual heart, actual caring\nNiggas get mad at me when I call out they hating\n'Cause they hatin', no debatin'\nAll on my dick and you know we ain't dating\nBitch nigga, let's face it\nWe came up out the mud, still got dirt on our faces, now we counting blue faces\nWhite girl slide down the pole and I'm throwing her faces\nI

hip-hop out the Drake era\nFuck a mob, fuck a squad, fuck your mans and them\nYou singing ass niggas don't know how to be men\nI hit your baby mama, gave that bitch a new tan\nI talk that greasy shit and hit them with a new dance\nOh my God, Peggy, Peggy, you're so good\nFuck whoever said you up to no good\n'Cause I'm the man in the street\nThe man with the beats\nAnd the man holding heat\nI drop bombs like I drop science (Whoo)\nDrop a body off like a dropped client\nDrop six, drop-top, drop FaceTime\nI give a fuck about peace, I spit hate crimes\nWho the fuck you know could kill 'em with these cold lines?\nYoung Peglord on the mic, bitch, it's go time\nI piss white boys off in my spare time\nTugging at your heart I'm the black Ben Carson\nSo try me if you really wanna\nNo seriously, try me if you really wanna (Yeah)\nWho the fuck told you Peggy wasn't getting paid?\nI square up with a square nigga and catch a fade\nYou might also like\nSwisher sweet, ain't nobody can fuck with

ass\nAnd you Metacritic rappers don't get no pass\nYou got these white girls singing\nThese white girls singing\nBut niggas never feel you so you play it like you different\nI'm a fucking grave digger, I don't see these boys\nYou step in my sandbox, you gon' see these toys\nYou suburban ass niggas need to stay in your place\nNo snaps, no tweets, this is straight to your face\nFuck 'em\nI bring death to any nigga that try to rattle me\nYou casualties actually factually you ain't as bad as me\nNiggas say they charged up\nI'ma drain your fucking battery\nSplit your ass in two and you still will never be half of me, Buster!\nFuck your mob, fuck your squad, fuck your mans and them\nYou indie niggas just wanna be black men\nI've been real all my life, you're like MC Ride\nTwo crackers call your album \"nigga,\" and you let that slide, pussy\nGet the fuck out of my genre, my genre\nGet the fuck out of my genre, my genre\nRich kids trying to go urban no shaman\nBut this a

never talk cop\nAnd my tracks make these white hoes strip\nNigga dead-ass, I love rap but I never buy the music\nI just download it for free, then I talk shit\nRhymin\u2019s easy, anyone can do it\nThat\u2019s why I say fuck that new, I want that old shit\nI\u2019m all indie, baby, I love garbage\nSling out wack tracks and Pitchfork loves it\nCritic-core legend, certified bitch-made\nAsshole niggas, thinkin' they got the best taste\nAt 27, I\u2019ma asphyxiate on my own bullshit\nWhile I\u2019m lookin' for a fix\nSo fuck a black fan, crackers make figures\n'Cause God don\u2019t like ugly and no one likes niggas\nYou might also like\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the lord my soul to take\nAnd If I stunt before I front\nI pray the lord just give me what I want\nAnd If I flash before that cash\nI pray the lord give me all of that\nAnd if I ain\u2019t rich before 26, well fuck (Uh)\nI hope they let me in the 27 club\nI\u2019m Janis Joplin, I sing like an old-time slave\nAnd I look twice my age\nLive from summertime, a OG vulture\nMother-fuck a spook, I'ma profit off the culture\nReal nigga lover, I used to play the backroom\nTrouble on my mind, I fuck hippies in the bathroom\nBig Mama Thorton my ball and chain\nBitch I'ma do you like Elvis did, never get credited\nOverdose on sedatives and heroin and medicine\nOppressed white female, I'm a mother-fucking feminist\nMirror mirror on the wall, tell me who I'm better than\nBitch, you not heaven sent, a thief is all you ever been\nOn the road to riches, they gon' catch me out my element\nBut if I play the victim, they gon' treat me like a veteran\nPot kettle rhetoric, vocal chords need severin'\nI never had an original bone in my skeleton\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the lord my soul to take\nAnd if I stunt before I front (Yeah)\nI pray the lord just give me what I want\nAnd if I flash before that cash\nI pray the lord give me all of that\nAnd if I ain\u2019t rich before 26, well fuck\nI hope they let me in the 27 club (Uh)\n\nThey call me Kurt Cobain, I don't like fame\nI strum guitars, I snort cocaine\nI am one fucked up nigga\nThe Earth is my bedroom, the sky is my mirror\nAnd I look up in that bitch like er'day\nSmile to myself and thank God I'm paid\nBecause I could be like you, a keyboard warrior\nYouTube confessin' in the comment section\nDick gettin' hard off a thumbs up blessin'\nAnd when you get ignored\nIt's like, \"Fuck, now I'm stressin'!\"\nI took the high road\nInstead of bein' the nigga that talk shit\nI'd rather be the nigga that walks it\nHop, skip and jump 'cause I'm rich as hell\nStick to the script like an actor\nBut I don't play no roles, I'm hip-hop's Death Note\nI'm killin' off every single fuckin' blog rapper, bitch\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the lord my soul to take\nAnd if I stunt before I front\nI pray the lord just give me what I want\nAnd if I flash before that cash\nI pray the lord give me all of that\nAnd

shit\nI\u2019m all indie, baby, I love garbage\nSling out wack tracks and Pitchfork loves it\nCritic-core legend, certified bitch-made\nAsshole niggas, thinkin' they got the best taste\nAt 27, I\u2019ma asphyxiate on my own bullshit\nWhile I\u2019m lookin' for a fix\nSo fuck a black fan, crackers make figures\n'Cause God don\u2019t like ugly and no one likes niggas\n\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the lord my soul to take\nAnd If I stunt before I front\nI pray the lord just give me what I want\nAnd If I flash before that cash\nI pray the lord give me all of that\nAnd if I ain\u2019t rich before 26, well fuck (Uh)\nI hope they let me in the 27 club\nI\u2019m Janis Joplin, I sing like an old-time slave\nAnd I look twice my age\nLive from summertime, a OG vulture\nMother-fuck a spook, I'ma profit off the culture\nReal nigga lover, I used to play the backroom\nTrouble on my mind, I fuck hippies in the bathroom\nBig Mama Thorton my ball and chain\nBitch I'ma do you like Elvis did, never get credited\nOverdose on sedatives and heroin and medicine\nOppressed white female, I'm a mother-fucking feminist\nMirror mirror on the wall, tell me who I'm better than\nBitch, you not heaven sent, a thief is all you ever been\nOn the road to riches, they gon' catch me out my element\nBut if I play the victim, they gon' treat me like a veteran\nPot kettle rhetoric, vocal chords need severin'\nI never had an original bone in my skeleton\n\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the lord my soul to take\nAnd if I stunt before I front (Yeah)\nI pray the lord just give me what I want\nAnd if I flash before that cash\nI pray the lord give me all of that\nAnd if I ain\u2019t rich before 26, well fuck\nI hope they let me in the 27 club (Uh)\n\nThey call me Kurt Cobain, I don't like fame\nI strum guitars, I snort cocaine\nI am one fucked up nigga\nThe Earth is my bedroom, the sky is my mirror\nAnd I look up in that bitch like er'day\nSmile to myself and thank God I'm paid\nBecause I could be like you, a keyboard warrior\nYouTube confessin' in the comment section\nDick gettin' hard off a thumbs up blessin'\nAnd when you get ignored\nIt's like, \"Fuck, now I'm stressin'!\"\nI took the high road\nInstead of bein' the nigga that talk shit\nI'd rather be the nigga that walks it\nHop, skip and jump 'cause I'm rich as hell\nStick to the script like an actor\nBut I don't play no roles, I'm hip-hop's Death Note\nI'm killin' off every single fuckin' blog rapper, bitch\n\nAnd if I die before I wake\nI pray the lord my soul to take\nAnd if I stunt before I front\nI pray the lord just give me what I want\nAnd if I flash before that cash\nI pray the lord give me all of that\nAnd if I ain\u2019t rich before 26, well fuck\nI hope they let me in the 27 club\n\nAlright, here, then I walk into it, like, as the slums go\nThen keep it straight up there and then-\nYep"

Dent mixed with Michael Jackson\nI can't even get jiggy with these niggas, I feel like Michael Blackson\nAnd y'all got thirty niggas on a beat, that shit is Frankenstein\nI'm outstreamin' every nigga

like no main squeeze\nShe don\u2019t even ask me who I hang with, she know I cheat\nThese bitches don\u2019t even speak my language, I\u2019m finna leave (These bitches , look in though the

Lyrics\nNo turning back\n\nWhen I was just eighteen, the judge put me on a list\nBitch, I ain't Baby Keem, my cousin ain't gave me shit\nThey don't want no Peggy on the scene, so I pray 'fore I fuck on they bitch\n'Cause they know that lyin' is a sin, but she used it to get by us, woo\nOne in the head of ya, a hunnid gon' follow, that flew on the case\nTold her these bust out the school with the A\nEatin' these rappers, we ain't sayin' grace\nI'm finna slide in your girl like I'm safe\nDoubled up on these niggas like Ma$\u0435, wait\nUh, I'm finna make it start boomin', babe\nGettin' shitfac\u0435d, I don't even wan' face it\nThink my shit laced 'cause these niggas so basic\nTatted in the face, I'm ahead of my time\nKool Keith, that'll save you a lot\nRappers want credit but just get declined (Damn, ayy, ayy)\nUh, transform on these bitches like Optimus\nPlayin' these crackers like Oculus\nPeggy and Danny, no stoppin' us, come and shop with us\nMLG, no toppin' us\nThe white boy in me keep poppin' up, shake it\nAnd my bitch is the same when she wasted\nCall her boo when I hear that she shakin', yeah\nAnd you hate that\nYou might also like\nNo turning back, yeah\n\nIt's the all back up off the sauce\nStacks it, caution, crawl back with offers\nAll lack the boss up, toss up the fent\nA hit, my mouth wack, that dick up on the track\nBe scared, all cap, big pocket when I pick pockets\nZiploc it, let me flip topics\nDrop it on the run like someone's father\nFuckin' niggas heads up like county jail barbers\nMore highs than Mrs. Parker and lows like blind dates\nI rise like crime rates when unemployment is up\nYou suck with bad taste, ain't no fuckin' with us\nMy nigga, just give it up\nCatch you like you forgot your lines\nJoggin' early with the Rollie, that's a race against time\nYou ain't fuckin' with mine\nNo way you're fuckin' with mine, ayy\nIt's all there, you ain't gotta count it\nI don't want a bad bitch, just need a real rounded\nBe from the city, we focused on hope\nFuck this ho with my nose, so we focused on dough\nWrote a note to myself, forgot where I put it\nDon't remember what it said, so I gave up lookin'\nGuess I need to slow down 'round brown weed\nBrown fiend, you got a change?\n'Fore I end up like Clarence Weatherspoon\nNiggas better read the room or get canceled like sellin' chitlin spoons\nI have decided to follow Jesus\nNo turning back\nI'm a legend, with the essence\nOf a reverend that was pimpin' in the '70s, ha-ha-ha-ha\nNow we save them bitches, that's what I call longevity\nI'm hotter than corduroys in St. Croix\nRemember days for dinner all we had was egg rolls, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha\nBut ended up with greens in bed rolls\nEye rolls and head shake could break any second\nGotta give niggas, oh, whatever, man\nI'm extra cautious, whatever you call it\nParanoid, I guess, but I feel like a target\nPardon me if I come off aggressive, extra defensive\nOffended by your presence\nSo let me get a second, you'll always be second\nI'ma give you a lesson, this is chess, not checkers\nCame too far to get near-sighted, lights blinded\nNo guidance, gone off track\nRunnin' lights, railroad, blindsided\nTry to keep my guard up knowin' I can't fight it\nWent left on the wrong path, somewhere got misguided\nSayin' I'm done, back again, livin' free, trapped again\nWhen it's all said and done, we'll see what's happenin'\nToo old for mistakes and too young for an accident\nFeelin' like I'm captive, wanna get away\nDepressed when it's sunny so I pray for rainy days\nEvery time I think I found it, I went astray\nThey wanna give you what you need\nBut never let you get your way\nLivin' too fast, everything goin' slow\nSeeds planted, I'm just waitin' on the grow\nKeep it to myself, everything ain't for show\nUsed to think I knew it all, but now I don't know, a-ha-ha2Embed\nNo turning back\n\nWhen I was just eighteen, the judge put me on a list\nBitch, I ain't Baby Keem, my

I make my appearance\nShow up incoherent, niggas know I'm a degenerate\nWake up every morning, night before, I don't remember it\nThick bitch, don't know her name but I won't get into it\nHundred on the nightstand 'cause I'm so generous\n(Bruiser Brigade!) (Check!)\nOh well, what you make in a year spent those smoking charges at hotels\nDon't even know the last time I cut my own toenails\nSipping on that Henny, I can't tell you how broke smells\nWrite like I'm chiseling on cave walls\nA thousand years later, they can break a voicemail\nWhen death calls, won't answer to no one\nCame up in this bitch by myself with no gun\nEverybody askin' me, \"Where ya get ya coke from?\"\nUnderground like archaeologist\nShould be in the psych ward for what I do with vocal chords\nCall that bitch a totem pole, my face be all up on the board\nInside the vocal booth, we're running out of Bud\nA loony thing what I do when you can't\nSome people saying that I'm shallow, but I'm jumping off the deep end\n'Bout to flip the script, I ain't even read the treatment\nLike terms of services, they all in agreement\nUsed to work the block and I ain't never filed a grievance\nTalk to me soft like you can keep a secret\nLower down your voice 'cause it's a high chance of leakage\nKnow some rappers talking but I could never speak it\nWas told to keep my mouth closed and just mind my business\nMalicious intent, I made that rent\nSketched out by any car that drove by with tints\nGo!Embed\n(I've named this one JPEG)\n\nOk, my bitch, she bad\nShe got me out my zone\nI make her shake that ass\nThis house is not a home\nI double-fist the cash\nDon't need no payday loan\nThey be like \"Bitch, who that?\"\nI got top on the phone\n.45 in the flo' seat\nAnd if you know, then you know, you don't know me\nI'm waiting for my opps to come, they better show me\nAnd I talk how I talk, bitch blow me, woo!\n\nFuck you talking about\nOh, let's go\nGet money, nigga\nThe bands\n\nMoney made in a Harley\nAnd we don't click with all this pasting and you copies\nThat bitch let everybody in, she lik\u0435 the army\nOff top on your bitch like Darby\nI fuck your bitch, she fuck my bitch, that's an assist\n.45 is sick, I tak\u0435 my shots tongue out like KISS\nAnd the choppa young as Matt Gaetz b-\nYou think you crazy, well buddy, go enlist!\n\nFuck!\nLet's go\nGet money, nigga\nThe bands\n\nI'm a failed chemistry experiment\nTake some acid, playing Jimi, are you experienced?\nWhere's the fun, Clarence?
