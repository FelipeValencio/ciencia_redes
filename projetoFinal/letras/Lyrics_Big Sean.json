  "plain": "Sean Michael Leonard Anderson (born March 25, 1988), known professionally as Big Sean, is an American hip hop recording artist from Detroit, Michigan. Sean signed with Kanye West\u2019s GOOD Music in 2007, Def Jam Recordings in 2008 and Roc Nation in 2014. After releasing several mixtapes, Sean released his debut album, Finally Famous, in 2011.\n\nFresh off one of the coldest features of the year on Drake\u2019s \u201cAll Me,\u201d Sean released his second studio album, Hall of Fame, on August 27, 2013. Sean\u2019s third studio album, Dark Sky Paradise, was released in 2015 and earned him his first No. 1 studio album. The album featured hits like the banger \u201cI Don\u2019t Fuck With You\u201d, which peaked at #11 and went quadruple platinum, and the Drake-assisted \u201cBlessings\u201d, which went double platinum.\n\nTWENTY88, a group composed of Sean and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, released a self-titled album on March 28th, 2016. The group was titled as such as both artists turned 28 during 2016, as both were born in 1988.\n\nIn February 2017, he dropped his fourth studio album, I Decided, which debuted at No. 1, becoming his second consecutive No. 1 album. The album featured the double-platinum hit \u201cBounce Back\u201d. The song peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard 100, making it his highest charting song to date.\n\nOn December 8th of the same year, Big Sean and Metro Boomin combined for Sean\u2019s fifth studio, and first collaborative album, Double Or Nothing.\n\nHe would later return with another studio album, Detroit 2, which serves as a sequel to his 2012 mixtape Detroit. Arguably his most acclaimed album to date, it contained a host of features, including Eminem, Travis Scott,  Lil Wayne, Young Thug, Post Malone, and more, and contained the ten-minute Friday Night Cypher, a ten-minute track featuring a collection of Detroit-based rappers. It became his third straight No. 1 album."

Music, 'Ye weather\nChampagne just tastes better\nThey told me I never, boy, never say \"never\"\nSwear flow special like an infant's first steps\nI got paid then reversed debts\nThen I finally found a girl that reverse stress\nSo now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death\nYep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride\nShow him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried\nShow him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside\nNo matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind\nBut fuck tryin' and not doin'\n\u2018Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'\nI said, \"fuck tryin' and not doin'\"\n\u2018Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'\nI grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined\nSo until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that \"Juicy\" vid\nBitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'\nGo against me, you won't stop losin'\nFrom the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome\nNiggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan\nYeah, I know that shit ain't fair\nThey say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor\nYou write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone\nI knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long\nWe on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody\nRep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody\nI'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot\nThe city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic\nAnd I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas\nThen run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot\nI'm one of the hottest because I flame drop\nDrop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'\nAnd I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs\n\u2018Cause that ain't the way of a OG\nSo I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar\nNever changed though, I'm just the new version of old me\nForever hot-headed but never got cold feet\nGot up in the game, won't look back at my old seats\nClique so deep we take up the whole street\nI need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week\nSean Don\nYou might also like\nMiscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds\nDevilish grin for my alias aliens to respond\nPeddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize\nI'm not gonna fold or demise\nI don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!\nBitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon\nSo if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc\nDon't you pop me no fuckin' pill\nI'ma pop you, then give you this\n\nTell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit\nSo many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit\nSo many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch\nOne at a time, I line them up\nAnd bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids\nI'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists\nI'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork\nI'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York\nKing of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both\nThe juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes\nLive in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces\nCartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas\nWho the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?\nIf Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me\nI'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!\nFuck y'all pictures!

count stacks\nKnew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back\n(You ain\u2019t getting checks)\nLast night took a L, but tonight I bounce back\nBoy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back\nD town LAX, every week I bounce back\nIf you a real one, then you know how to bounce back\n\nDon\u2019t owe nobody, owe nobody\nAlways on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies\nGot the city fuckin'

ya new shit, it's pathetic\nYa contract should be shredded\nTook my dogs on a private jet from the public housing\nI kept it G, yeah, one thousand\nClique star-studded like the Paramount mountain\nEverything I do is righteous\nBetting on me is the right risk\nEven in a fucking crisis\nI\u2019m never on some switching sides shit\nI switch gears to the night shift\nBlacking out 'cause I\u2019m enlightened\nGod talk to me in silence\nBut I hear him every time, mane\n(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)\nYou might also like\nLast night took a L, but tonight I bounce

not respect my authority\nIf you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory\nI done did everything except worry\nHella drama, my life story\nFaith of a mustard seed, I kept growing\nI knew that this life was meant for me\nNiggas change up more than wishin' wells\nKarma come around I'll wish 'em well\nLivin' like I\u2019m on a limitless pill\nI kill the scene like I\u2019m Denzel\nCrazy like

No favors\nClique too big, bread gotta break it\n'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'\nEverything lined up for the takin'\nAnd what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors (No)\nWhat I need? No favors\nEverything lined up for the takin' (Yeah-yeah)\nAnd what I need from 'em? No favors (Look)\n\nI'm about gettin' the job done, boy, up every night\nI'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice (Dice)\nI'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice\nI'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life (Woah)\nTell 'em point and shoot like camera crews\nIn front of cameras too (Brrr)\nDamn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?\nI'm like, \"Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too\"\nThought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too\nMotherfuck all your comparisons (Fuck 'em)\nI've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist\nI'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit\nBut a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin' shit\nDon, don, don life (Don), I do this for the crib, the D to Flint (Woah)\nKids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead\nFrom where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up (No)\nOnly deals I had was from the Sam's Club\nNow it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for\nBorn in a world goin' where they told me I can't go\nIn my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt\nGet ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for\nWhen my grandma died I realized I got an angel\nShow me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles\nLook, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies\nThat's my new lifetime policy\nWoodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship (Swerve, swerve)\nHow many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'\nThe pictures we been paintin'?

My - my stepbrother used to flip them bags\nOutside the crib like it was trash day\nNo Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)\nBut when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash\nWith all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas\nLook, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it\nTell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it\nSuccess is on the way, I feel it in the distance\nUsed to look up at the stars\nAnd be like, \"Ain't too much that's different\"\nI be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it\nWhat you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?\nYou might also like\nAnd I hope you learn to make it on your own\nAnd if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone\nI hope that you get everything you want and that you chose\nI hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know\nHope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything\nMillion-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams\nAnd when you get it all, just remember one thing\nRemember one thing, one man could change the world\nOne man could change the world\n\nMy grandma told me, \"If you write your name in stone\nYou'll never get the white-out\"\nI grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House\nStandin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed\nI said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks\nWhere I'm from, I swear they broke\nThey need way more than the cast\nWe need more than what you have\nAnd then we need more than that\nBut how am I supposed to say I'm tired\nIf that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions\nThat I couldn't survive?\nWent to war, came back alive\nOn top of that became a female black captain\nWhen being black, you had to extra-extra try\nWay before James Brown made us proud\nShe bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye\nRight there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive\nAnd she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right\nTaught me how to love, taught me not to cry\nWhen I die, I hope you teach me how to fly\nAll my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...\nI hope you learn to make it on your own\nAnd if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone\nI hope that you get everything you want and that you chose\nI hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know\nHope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything\nMillion-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams\nAnd when you get it all, just remember one thing\nRemember one thing, that one man can change the world\nThat one man can change the world\n\nThank you for callin' me, been thinkin' about you\nIt's all good, I love you grandma\nBye321Embed\n\nThey used to tell me, used to tell me\n\nI hope you learn to make it on your own\nAnd if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone\nI hope that you get everything you want and that you chose\nI hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know\nHope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything\nMillion-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams\nAnd when you get it all, just remember one thing\nRemember one thing, that one man could change the world\nThat one man could change the world\n\nAll I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick\nImagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it\nBack on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots\nBut it's hard makin' those attachments\nI'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day\nYou know?

Who promotin' your L?\nWho be hopin' you fail? Nigga, Oprah and Gayle\nIgnore the hate, show the world that we love the opps\nCall Lyor great while they make rape Russell docs\nNah\n\n(Okay, yeah)\n(Hit-Boy)\nYeah\n(G. Ry got me)\n\nBitch, you have never said a clever line ever\nYou murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth\nRest assured, I'ma treat this roof like I'm peelin' off (What?)\nThe plastic on a pill bottle, I'm tearin' the ceilin' off, yeah\nRipping rappers like they were wrapped in Saran, bitch\nAnd I'm strapped up with ammunition\nAnd single-handedly takin' over the game like I had an actual hand missing\nBut I only need one to clap\nAnimal ambition\nThe only butt-fuckin' way that you're strapped is for cash\nWish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin' imaginary little handgun you're brandishin'\nBitch, if you pull up with the stick\nIt's a car with a manual transmission\nThe chances are low to none that I will overcome my bipolar one\nVoodoo dolls, I'm just pokin' fun, pins to me are like loaded guns\nWhen I'm holdin' one, if I'm just fiddlin' with it\nThis motherfucker discharges like me checkin' myself out of the fucking mental hospital\nAnd I get off like an acquittal, I spit it, you critique it\nIt feels like I'm bein' belittled by midgets\nIt's like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka\nAnd walkin' right up in the middle of a little kids' fuckin' pillow fight with it\nYou want smoke? I'm like hookah\nMan, I remember back when I used to get jumped for my fucking Pumas\nRun home and go fuck my room up\nThese streets will try to vacuum you up\nThat's why the avenue where I grew up was 8 Mile and Hoover (What?)\n'Cause it sucked like a Roomba\nBut even if I would've went the indie route\nI don't have any doubt\nI would still get blown like it's windy out\nShoot 'til the clip is emptied out\nThis is the beginning of the ending, but I'll put another clip in and spit these rounds\nIf I dig deep down when I'm in my bag like Fendi\nWho am I offending now?\nGot so many fucking detractors, feels like I'm gettin' plowed\nHad to put my money on a diet, I got too many pounds\nYou would think I'm turnin' pages the way that I'm flippin' paper\nMiddle fingers, them bitches get to wavin' like friendly neighbors\nI'm talkin' loot like I'm rioting\nDick is so big, I can't fit the entire thing through a tire swing\nI don't think it'd be logic for me to say that I'm retirin'\nBut I should say bye-bye, earthlings\n'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this \"Grindin'\" beat, yeah\nI took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song\nYou listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart\nSo when I'm rippin', it's hard to tell whether if it is really because\nOf how offensive I am, or just what a bitch that you are\nLike I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul\nLike I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and I'm quick on the draw\nYeah, so when I pull it, surprise (Pull it, surprise), like Kendrick Lamar\nYou need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog\n'Cause y'all are missing a heart\nPlus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz\nThis shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping\nY'all got detention tomorrow\nI'm severe like Benzo withdrawal\nBitch, your skin's gonna crawl\nI'm invincible, I've been through it all\nLike I never thought about just ending it 'til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall\nMy back was against\nNow I rap like I'm possessed, that's nine-tenths of the law\nOh\nOh, fuck it"

taking double shots, saying fuck a single\nYou know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though\nLook, I know what it feel like to think you found the one\nTold mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb\nCause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha\nAnd saying \"Hi Britney\" when I'm on the phone with Lisa\nFuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls\nPussy get wet as an S-Curl\nThen I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl\nAnd how it was the worst times but she was the best girl\nYou know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind\nGot my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line\n(The number you dialed has been disconnected)\nMan, but before I started feeling bad\nMy nigga text me like \"I got some hoes, hit me back\"\nFuck it\n\nOh I could let you down\nWhen you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya\nWe get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right\nYou know it ain't right if she ain't by my side\nWith this crazy, crazy world\nThank God I'm with my girl\nWe get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right\nYou know it ain't right if she ain't by my side\nWith this crazy, crazy world\nThank God I'm with my girl\nYou might also like\nYou be the momma, you be the daddy\nBaby, we could play house, I'll change your addy\nOr even change my palate and fuck with salad\nPut me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh\nCan't even stunt I was sprung from the jump\nNever got head while flaming up the blunt\nYou were my first, I'm just saying\nMore folks should try it, it's crazy\nFocus, selfish moments, on road, I done have my share\nFlying out of town like baby don't mind my player\nSleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer\nAnd the air so tired I forget to recline my chair\nPicture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs\nSome scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says\nAin't a single living thing that likes living single\nWe good over here, that's all that we know\n\nOh I could let you down\nWhen you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya\nWe get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right\nYou know it ain't right if she ain't by my side\nWith this crazy, crazy world\nThank God I'm with my girl\nWe get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right\nYou know it right if she ain't by my side\nWith this crazy, crazy world\nThank God I'm with my girl\nTo the one girl guys who claim they don't need more\nLike my nigga Henry, he married at 24\nI'm like why nigga, why?\nYou supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?\nHe like, \"ahhh\"\nFuck it, we about to do therapy\nAyy, at least when I hit the doctor I'm carefree with no plan b's\nYou probably never got tested and have that type of clarity\nI'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee\nBut I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do\nIt\u2019s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods\nOr how when I'm with her I feel whole too\nGo on, keep living that life you niggas know you too old to\nFuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen\nEven though he on target with everything I've been missing\nThe closest thing I had to that came in at 4 AM and out at 8 for work\nAnd I'm the reason we ain't make it work\nThat's what makes it worse\nDamn\n\nOh I could let you down\nWhen you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya\nWe get ahead, yup, she give me head,

fuck!)\nI done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular\nBut I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn\nVoices in my head saying I could do better\n(You always do the same shit)\n\nThis was supposed to be the last time, last hit\nLast call, last feel, last trip, last run\nThat's what I always tell myself, huh, damn\nThis was supposed to be the last one, last two\nLast flip, last you, last me, last night\nDoing every single thing my parents warned me 'bout\n(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit\n\nVoices in my head saying I could do better\n(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)\nVoices in my head saying that I knew better\n(Yeah, you know what's about to go down)\nI done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular\nBut I still, fuck\n(That's your problem, you don't listen!)\nYou might also like\n\nVoices in my head, conscience talking to me like\nLook\nMetro Boomin want some more, nigga\n\nStick to the plan, stick to the plan\nStick to the plan, bitch quit playing\nStick to the, plan, to the plan\nStick to the plan, bitch quit playing\nStick to the, plan\n\nStay focused\nDon't let these niggas see your emotions\nStick to the notion, stay in motion\nRemember soon as you stand still\nSo will everything else you notice\nMake sure all your inner actions end with actions\nIf you stacking fronting and back in\nSubtract if it isn't adding\nPlus who hurt you don't let back in\nPlan it out, yeah, tit for tat it\nExtra pussy get distracted\nPut that into what's worth having (boy)\nStick to the plan, stick to the plan\nStick to the plan, bitch quit playing\nStick to the, plan, to the plan\nStick to the plan, bitch quit playing\nStick to the, plan\n\nStay focused (stay focused)\nPay attention who you getting close with\nDistance yourself from negative energy\nVoices in my head, they say it's meant for me\nI, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy\nI, I, I, been plotting this since elementary\nI, I, I, no you need to buckle down\nHave people asking where you at\nAnd wondering why you never wanna come around\nYou know that effort gon' come around\nBig face like Zordon\nYou bought the watch but can't afford the time\nEven if you running out of breath\nWeight of the world doing lots of reps\nTime to get this generation\nLast one and then the next two outta debt\nAnd they gon' pay you back with respect\nJust stick to the plan, still, we can chill\nBack when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills\nI realized there's no dream that I can't fill\nI manifested all while I'm the man still\n(Bitch I'm the man)\nVoices in my head attacking what I'm thinking\nBullet to the head might be the way to free it\nIf I leave my body I can free the spirits\nSwear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking\nWishing I could go back to the nineties\nBack when I was dreaming\nMe and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan\nEarly 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons\nWondering when I started losing it, the losing grip\nFeeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean\nYou either drown or canoe through it\nVoices in my head said I'm used to it\nSome help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it\nWhen I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it\nI know in life you either blow it or blew it\nAnd at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it\nI just hope by then I cut the voices in my head47Embed\n\nVoices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn\nVoices in my head sayin' that I knew better\n(You know better, what the fuck!)\nI done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular\nBut I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn\nVoices in my head saying I could do better\n(You always do the same shit)\n\nThis was supposed to be the last time, last hit\nLast call, last feel, last trip, last run\nThat's what I always tell myself, huh, damn\nThis was supposed to be the last one, last two\nLast flip, last you, last me, last night\nDoing every single thing my parents warned me 'bout\n(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit\n\nVoices in my head saying I could do better\n(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)\nVoices in my head saying that I knew better\n(Yeah, you know what's about to go down)\nI done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular\nBut I still, fuck\n(That's your problem, you don't listen!)\n\n\nVoices in my head, conscience talking to me like\nLook\nMetro Boomin want some more, nigga\n\nStick to the plan, stick to the plan\nStick to the plan, bitch quit playing\nStick to the, plan, to the plan\nStick to the plan, bitch quit playing\nStick to the, plan\n\nStay focused\nDon't let these niggas see your emotions\nStick to the notion, stay in motion\nRemember soon as you stand still\nSo will everything else you notice\nMake sure all your inner actions end with actions\nIf you stacking fronting and back in\nSubtract if it isn't adding\nPlus who hurt you don't let back in\nPlan it out, yeah, tit for tat it\nExtra pussy get distracted\nPut that into what's worth having (boy)\n\nStick to the plan, stick to the plan\nStick to the plan, bitch quit playing\nStick to the, plan, to the plan\nStick to the plan, bitch quit playing\nStick to the, plan\n\nStay focused (stay focused)\nPay attention who you getting close with\nDistance yourself from negative energy\nVoices in my head, they say it's meant for me\nI, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy\nI, I, I, been plotting this since elementary\nI, I, I, no you need to buckle down\nHave people asking where you at\nAnd wondering why you never wanna come around\nYou know that effort gon' come around\nBig face like Zordon\nYou bought the watch but can't afford the time\nEven if you running out of breath\nWeight of the world doing lots of reps\nTime to get this generation\nLast one and then the next two outta debt\nAnd they gon' pay you back with respect\nJust stick to the plan, still, we can chill\nBack when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills\nI realized there's no dream that I can't fill\nI manifested all while I'm the man still\n(Bitch I'm the man)\n\nVoices in my head attacking what I'm thinking\nBullet to the head might be the way to free it\nIf I leave my body I can free the spirits\nSwear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking\nWishing I could go back to the nineties\nBack when I was dreaming\nMe and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan\nEarly 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons\nWondering when I started losing it, the losing grip\nFeeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean\nYou either drown or canoe through it\nVoices in my head said I'm used to it\nSome help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it\nWhen I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it\nI know in life you either blow it or blew it\nAnd at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it\nI just hope by then I cut the voices in my head"

What's that? What's) My bitch\nHold up, hold up, whoa there\nLet's capture this moment (Boy, boy)\nIf I hit it then I own it, marijuan'-in' every mornin' (We on)\nAnd Patr\u00f3n-ing, girl, we groaning (Do it)\nBut that pussy got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on\n(Street lights on, on?)

taking double shots, saying fuck a single\nYou know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though\nLook, I know what it feel like to think you found the one\nTold mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb\nCause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha\nAnd saying \"Hi Britney\" when I'm on the phone with Lisa\nFuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some xxx girls\nPussy get wet as an s-curl\nThen I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl\nAnd how it was the worst times but she was the best girl\nYou know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind\nGot my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line\n(The number you dialed has been disconnected)\nMan, but before I started feeling bad\nMy nigga text me like, \"I got some hoes, hit me back,\" fuck it\n\nOh I could\nLet you down\nI don't know why\nYou keep my mind\nRacing again\nYou kiss my lips\nWhen you trip\nI'll take you anywhere\nI'll take you\nYou might also like\nYeah, let's get ahead, yup\nWe get ahead, that's right\nI know it ain't right if she ain't by my side\nIn this crazy kinda world\nI'm glad I got my girl\nYeah, let's get ahead, yup\nWe get ahead, that's right\nI know it ain't right if she ain't by my side\nIn this crazy kinda world\nI'm glad I got my girl\n\nYou be the momma, you be the daddy\nBaby, we could play house, I'll change your addy\nOr even change my palate and fuck with salad\nPut me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh\nCan't even stunt I was sprung from the jump\nNever got head while flaming up the blunt\nYou were my first, I'm just saying\nMore folks should try it, it's crazy\nFocus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share\nFlying out of town like baby don't mind my player\nSleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer\nAnd the air so tired I forget to recline my chair\nPicture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs\nSome scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says\nAin't a single living thing that likes living single\nWe good over here, that's all that we know\nYeah, oh I could\nLet you down\nI don't know why\nYou keep my mind\nRacing again\nYou kiss my lips\nWhen you trip\nI'll take you anywhere\nI'll take

ahead, that's right\nI know it ain't right if she ain't by my side\nIn this crazy kinda world\nI'm glad I got my girl\nPink caddy, Pepto-Bismobile\nTing named Cali, that ass on sunset hill\nA beautiful view, unusual, I'm hooked on the real\nAnd you would be too, I'm pookie bout that coochie, for real\nOkay cool, I guess I love the way you\nNourish the soul, you know that ass look like a fuckin' grapefruit\nHitting them push-ups so when I'm up in that what's up, what's up you get whooped up\nArch that thing like where I'm from, been on my brain, miss serotonin\nLiving la vida with my Lavita, feel like Ceddy\nLiberate your limbs eliminate your limits, let me\nYou feel just like lemonade on ice when I'm all sweaty\nShe said, \"Smino, boy I get it all ready\"\nYeah, let's get ahead, yup\nWe get ahead, that's right\nI know it ain't right if she ain't by my side\nIn this crazy kind of world\nI'm glad I've got my girl\nYeah, let's get ahead, yup\nWe get ahead, that's right\nI know

tonight)\nMan, that doesn't make it right\nMan, that doesn't make it right\nHow do you sleep at night?\n\nSean, nigga you on, damn, nigga, you on\nYou was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home\nDamn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong\nYou got time for that gig, but not time for the phone\nGot it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends\nI seen your ass up on TV,  touched up on them twins\nYou don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz\nGet tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, whoa\nNiggas want handouts, and I only got two\nNow I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you\nGettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit\nAin't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew\nNow I'm in court for some shit I didn't do\nCause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through\nSo when it's time to travel management say I only need two\nListenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules\nI'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose\nThis the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze\nLately, though my family been too happy\nI just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy\nPeople thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that\nI been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that\nWorry 'bout my next Rolex time piece\nMy nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice\nWe supposed to be the role models\nNo wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college\nYou might also like\nIs this the example I'm tryna set?\nAre these the people I'mma forget?\nAre these

you got ahead tonight)\nMan, that doesn't make it right\nMan, that doesn't make it right\nHow do you sleep at night?\n\nOkay, you win some, lose some, break some, bruise some\nLife could be a test, multiple choice, choose some\nChoose one, stick with it, man, prove some\nSometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin'\nReal life will teach your ass way fucking fast\nI always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last\nI got four aunties, two uncles, one dad\nOne mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad\nAnd it's only one me, divide it and do the math\nI'm the one that dropped out, got no time for the class\nHow am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said?\nI don't even have time for everything in my head\nOn my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot\nWishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots\nMan thats drama, drama drama\nSo deep that call each others mamas' mamas\nWe need a break I mean comma, comma comma\nI'm tryin,

trickster\nIt can fuck you 'round, but your heart will never lie to you\nAnd that\u2019s why people love you, Sean\nBecause you talk to them from the heart\n(Thanks, dad)\nThat\u2019s why you're magical, Sean\nIt\u2019s no mistake that you\u2019re where you are right now\nYou speaking that from your brain, but they hear you from your heart\nBecause people can see your bullshit\nAnd I know

SEAN!)\n\nJust to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches\nThanking God Almighty, condoms were invented\nCause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons\nMan. who claim she never did it (Yeah right)\nBut under these conditions, she was with it\nThen I hopped up on that red eye when I finished\nI been gone for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning\nFucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it\nGetting rest that I be missing\nBut fuck it I'm on a mission\nFlight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate\nNow it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot\nI know the Program Director hot\nBut I spit a freestyle up in there so cold\nThat everybody in that bitch forgot, now I'm running late for sound check\nAnd I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station\nAnd that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme\nManager said we ain't got time, but time to time\nYou gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around\nI say \"Aye dawg, What you got?\", \"Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot\nUm, alright, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid\nTryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid\nUm, I'm like a young black Eminem\nIt's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan\nTryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them\nAnd a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it\nI mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I\nSo I give him my email on the fly\nAnd if his song's good I'll reply\n\nTrick Trick: Hello\nShorty: Ay nigga, Ay trick, where you at nigga\nTrick Trick: Ay what up, whats good, whats up man?\nShorty: Ay bro, ay nigga I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg\nTrick: What!\nShorty: Bro, haha, I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg, aye\nTrick: Oh hell naw, what?\nShorty: Hey I ran into this nigga, but aye he cool as hell man\nTrick: Awwww Dang! Tight!\nShorty: Bet, He short as hell though\nBoth: Hahahaha\nShorty: But that nigga was cool though man\nTrick: Alright!\nShorty: Man just like how he spit a hundred bars, I spit like two hundred bars\n\nTell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith\nIn something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe\nWhat you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch\nWhat you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe\nBut when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E\nAll the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need\nAll the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need\nI'm sorry\n\nI know you're not my child talking like that. Focus on shifting this negative energy, into something positive. And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, for your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha"

face\nIf I ain't going to get it that day is going to waste\nI'm tryna move in my safe like the safe was a safehouse\nI ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the stakeout\nAnd you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out\nI'm thumbing through the magazines like \"This the girl I'ma take out\"\nImagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way-way out\nAnd yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out\nAnd I've been waiting all goddamn year, oh yeah\nI can tell that it's near, but near ain't here\nMan, them bills is here right now\nI guess you shine brightest when the lights down like now\nAnd then they say it happened for me overnight, shit, yeah, I guess\nI guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success\nWhat you know 'bout living check to check to living check to check to check to check?\nFirst place, no neck and neck\nTwo girls is breast to breast to breast to breast\nBlowing smoke, but I'm a breath of fresh air\nYes, and I'm

broke, nigga\n\nMy, my, my, as the world turns\nToday if I don't earn, best believe I'm gon' learn\nIf I can't do either or, shit it's none of my concern\nWatch my enemies burn as I fulfill every yearn, ah\nReminiscing on the rappers I would look up to\nThe ones who want my feature price and the hookup too\nThe girls I fantasized about tryna hookup too\nNiggas seven feet, telling me I'm who they look up to\nHuh, and bitches still telling me to grow up\nDon't invite 'em to my shows but always still manage to show up\nMan, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion (Whoa)\nAnd I step inside the booth and change the world like I be votin'\nSo when you step inside my office, treat that bitch like it's the Oval\nEl presidente, lord, sensei\nDo ya job, it could be pay your rent day, getting risqu\u00e9\nCrazy nigga, they ain't seen it like this since 'Ye, yeah\nWell, this the life that I live\nCollecting everything overdue for all the work that I overdid\nD-Town but Chi-Town they love me like I'm Oprah, kid\nTryna make it to the top so I can let my dogs know it exist\n'Cause when you come from the bottom, man, it's so hard to just get a glimpse\nSo hard to get a glimpse, so while I'm here I might take a pic\nAnd show 'em that it's more to the world than tryna make a living\nLike changing it then looking back and saying that we did it\nOkay, como me llamo\nShe say, \"Ingles, no hablo,\" man, unless it's eat me out, though\nBenihana, my McDonald, all black leather jackets\nWhile I ride in my Diablo, swear I feel like I'm Keanu\nWishing Lamborghinis made a five do'\n'Cause I got too many real ma'fuckers I ride for, die for, uh\nStraight out the metropolitan\nMy city need a hero, so I treat it like Metropolis\nAnd it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can't name\nEven though I'm me, Lord knows that I can't save\nBut I'm still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch\nI came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain't rich\nBack when we was on college tours with Wale, man, we ain't make shit\nFrom Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge\nAnd Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate\nMan, we was tryna get away, man, we was tryna get ordained\nAnd damn, tomorrow never seemed so close\nAnd life ain't what it seem no mo'\n'Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast\nA million dollars never seemed so broke\nAnd every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with\nAnd niggas suin' me and they just banking on the settlement\nNever settlin', life is too fast just to settle in\nSo many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement\nLike damn\nYou might also like\nShit (Boy)\nCan't a young nigga live, man?\nWe done worked too hard\nYup (G.O.O.D.)\nFinally Famous\nLil' hoes\nWe ain't goin'

game is worth more than the seats\nMan fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone\nThey told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!\nI'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on\nMama had two jobs I know that she was working for me\nTen years later, hired to working for me\nHired the whole family like mobsters\nGetting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors\nGrandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city\nMan going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy\nLondon or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney\nParis, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' man!\nTexas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy\nAll the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me\nHeading to the money, whole city coming with me\nAnd I'mma rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!\n\nAnd this is how life should go\nEverything I wanted never seem so close\nGood people, good drinks, good smoke\nGot me thinking this is how life should go\nThis is how life should go\nEverything I wanted never seem so close\nFamily all around, all highs no lows\nGot me thinking this is how life should go\nYou might also like\nSitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher\nI keep it funky with my Mrs, fuck these other bitches\nAnd this ain\u2019t biblical but this sermon is spiritual\n\u2018Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few\nThe upper percentile\nWhipping whatever I, 460LS you\nI probably go less miles, stay in a small circle\nKnow that it\u2019s God working\nPolice got the swine flu and these niggas is reptiles\nYeah, Maybach poetic genius\nYou buying a seven jeans, keep mine in a 7 Bimmer\nI\u2019m trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it\nA fly nigga, I keep having a gravity grievance\nAnd while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features\nThat\u2019s like a complacent atheist is asking for Jesus\nRiding around without a fuck given\nBehind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten\nThe best in my position, I\u2019m passionate with lyrics\nAnd they ain\u2019t fucking with the kid like Chris Hansen in the kitchen\nI\u2019m handsome to these women, I\u2019m envied by these no ones\nThat\u2019s no Joakim Noah, nigga everybody know us\nAnd even if you don\u2019t drink everybody po\u2019 up\n\u2018Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon\u2019 show up\nNever hate on no one, your blessing\u2019s getting closer\nEven when I\u2019m open, it's nothing to Ed Cota wassup\nAnd this is how life should go\nEverything I wanted never seem so close\nGood people, good drinks, good

time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit\nAnd they ain't major shit, do yourself a favor, kick 'em out\nEat good and do that, you'll live a long life\nI always say long days is better than long nights\nAt least in the day you've got shade\nIn the nights it\u2019s all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights\nI wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th\nI used to think there's no such things as wrong rights\nTill my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries\nExtra cheese, now Mom could make her special recipe\nBut I didn't know it was off of infested streets\nNow he the reason I gotta walk with my little niece to go eat\nI guess that's the hunger that got me out\nAt the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know\nStuntin' like a bitch, prom night me out\nHad the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route\nThat was back when I was seventeen\nIt's crazy though, 'cause even then I thought I had It all figured out\n\nYou might also like\nIt's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed\n'Specially if you've got a vision\nOr how you could have everything\nAnd still think about everything missing\nLike I probably remember the times that I missed out on more than the ones I lived\nI probably remember the girls that I ain't have more than the ones I did\nBut I remain a two timing, one girl on the way\nTwo lying and one bed-never too tired\nSmoke so much I need two lighters\nShoppin' overseas I do buy it, who higher?\nThey taught me that I had to dream, Black History Month\nI wake up and treat the day like stack history month\nI'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson\nFront of the plane, I'm Rozay Parks\nSUV swervin' like it's O.J.' car\nOh, so me and my dogs is all gettin' out\nSomewhere in the club probably all liquored out\nFinna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out\nThat keep remindin' me at the same time\nThat I still ain't got it all figured out\nFact, the only thing I really figured out\nIs that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck\n\nEven when your bank account is all figured out\nEven when your bank account gets all figured out\nEven when your best friend gets all triggered out\nEven when it\u2026all of it\u2026when you still ain't got\u2026\nToday I woke up and realized every day gets shorter\nEvery minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending\nAge is nothing but a reminder\nAnd it doesn't tell you how old or young-minded someone is\n'Cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman's legs\nBut each have our own finish line\nUnderstand it never ends\nAnd the only way to be immortalized is to be remembered\nHopefully from right than wrong\nBetter to be in the hall of fame than shame\nWhether it exists for what you do or not\nWe create this world so we make what exists\nIt isn't about the award\nIt's about the award of being immortalized and remembered for all the right reasons\nMistakes are forgotten\nNo footprints of any missteps\nSo when it's so late that it's early\nAnd you need a drink even though the bar's closed\nRemember why you do what you do\nFor the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury\nThe adrenaline rush of creating what you think about\nWith who thinks about you\nYour family, your team\nThe joy of looking back and saying that you did it\nWinning the game\nHall of fame14Embed\nFinally Famous in this\u2026\n\nIt's

the right thing, you know you inspire me (You, you, you)\n\nYou tried to keep me away from temptation\nIntroduced me to The Temptations\nMarvin Gaye and Isley Brothers\nDancing so hard the living room shaking\nYeah we dance in the house\nMy mama's the man of the house\nMama you too good for them men\nEven dad, you too good for him\nMama, you know you inspire me\nYou deserve early retirement\nYou text me, tell me to take my vitamins\nWhen I got a new love you invite 'em in\nWhen we break up, you don't like 'em then (No)\nLoyal, loyal, swear you super loyal\nWorth more to me than striking oil\nYou deserve the life I'm tryna show ya\nI remember all of the sacrifices\nGrowing up in debt, but never hungry\nRich in everything except money\nThat's that faith that you can't buy\nBut I buy that new crib, you look right in it\nI buy that new car in the color that you like it in\nAnd play my song every single time you drive in it\nThat's 'cause you inspired it (yeah)\nYou might also like\nYou do the right thing, you know you inspire me\nYou do the right thing, you know you inspire me\nCan't go wrong, wrong, wrong\nYou do the right thing, you know you inspire me\n\nI know it's hard to get me on the line\nI'm busy like every other time\nSince I got a house in that other town\nYou wonder when I'ma come around\nI know you worry about me\nI give you attitude like, \"Don't worry 'bout it\"\nDon't hit ya up like I don't care about you\nBut I hold you down, I swear I got you\nI know I got problems communicating\nI probably should've went to school\nAnd got that degree in communications\nI should be with you on vacation\nI should take you where you should be taken\nAsia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy\nJust want you to know I do try\nTo take care of ya, mama\nYou the one, you the one, you the one\nYou the moon, you the stars, you the sun\nI'm so happy I'm your son\nI'm so happy I'm your son\nYou love me since day one\nSince before day one\nSo before the day's done\nI gotta, gotta let you know\nYou do the right thing, you know you inspire me\nYou do the right thing, you know you inspire me\nCan't go wrong, wrong, wrong\nYou do the right thing, you know you inspire me\n\nLook, mama, you know you inspire me\nIf I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology\nSo sorry, look, dear mama, you know your son shine for ya\nI'm Sean for ya, my lady\nDon't you ever let 'em talk to you crazy\nAnything for the fam, how you raise me\nI'm yo baby but you still my baby\nAyy8Embed\nYou do the right thing, you know you inspire me\nYou do the right

than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\n\nScared money never gon' make nothin', (thats right)\nGotta get it my medula\nCouple dollars in the waist band, (thats right)\nNigga hula-hoop with the mula\nEveryday that I wake I say grace\nHallelujah welcome back like Mase\nBitches only fuck niggas with the cream\nA nigga this fresh ain't never gon' date\nAy, they say we can't maintain\nOnly real niggas remain\n'Ye say that we the new slaves\nI need to ball with a chain\nI got a real bad bitch I haven't seen her in a month\nWith some twins so big she can put em' in a bunk\nOoh I love it when she drop it and spread it like\u00a0\nWhen I see the camel all I wanna do is hump\nOkay the Hall of Fame keep callin' my name\nGot a mural on the wall I'mma legend\nOkay, I'm from the motor city and been have drive\nI just need a little gas in my engine\nOkay, we all in the game and we ballin' the same but\nHome team nigga thats a blessing\nI'm a bad mothafucker just tryna get some credit\nSo good it can get me into heaven, nigga\n\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nAin't nothing more important than the mula\nHallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah"

Cause I stunt? Bag the tree like it's fall?\nThe girls that was out of my league trying to play with my balls\nI pay bills, I work hard, and when my mama cried a river\nThey never gave us a bridge, they gave us a bridge card\nNigga riding low, puffing on loud\nI came way too far to fuck it up now\nText from my mom said \"Me and your grandma proud\"\nI'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd\nTeacher told me to get a job, save up for 401(K)\nMan, I'd rather be young as shit counting 401k\nI'd rather die with a smile instead\nI'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs\nYou might also like\nI been this way before\nDreamed of havin' so much more\n\nBut I'm never dividing the bread\nBitch, I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred I deserve\nThrowing West side up like Pac up\nWhere they pop your block up, b-blocka big poppa flock off\nYou holy lil' whoaty holy kenobi chewbacca\nI'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I bet you that you won't find it\nRockin' Louis and MCM, I guess I'm clothes-minded\nObama suite, you one below up in the Joe Biden\nI'm in your city just chilling where all your hoes hiding?\n20k for the fit because it's 24 carats\nI can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it\nI'm just D-town repping\nMaking all these niggas who second-guessed regret it\nRegret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets\nAt least I realize now how much I love Ashley Marie\nAnd when it's all said and done, I'll probably get on my knee\nCause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring\nMan, she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET\nJust making it seem easy! Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy\n\nI been this way before (And the whole world see me)\nDreamed of havin' so much more (Bitch I know you see me)\nMan, I wake up to a wet dream\nEvery day's a Friday and every night's a sex scene\nEvery week is Fashion Week and every day I'm pressed clean\nDetroit's angel, I even got red wings\nHeaded to the ball, me and three prom queens\nIt's prom night, and guess who's the prom king?\nThey having a kissing fight and I'm Don King\nEverybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring\nTell me that wasn't the verse of the year\nMan, that shit deserves a hearse and a tear\nSwear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked\nAll my deals be overpaid and all my joints be overstuffed\nFinally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us\nSo take that check out and owe it up! Man, I turn impossible possible\nAnd what these niggas could barely see into optimal\nThe same teacher who told me rap is what not to do\nSaid I'm throwing my life away, if I drop out of school\nWant me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove\nIs that I did everything they told me not to do\nAfter I went down the road they told me not to cruise\nThey ain't know that was my road to success\nNow my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through\nMy dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional\nMy old school look like a T-Rex: I should feed her fossil fuels\nMan, I turn my enemies to molecules, lil' hoes\nWithout any preparation, I exceed these expectations\nMan they wanna see me dead, but I gave 'em dedication\nAnd I'm yelling fuck 'em all with a hundred exclamations\nCause I'ma be the man til my fucking expiration\nI been this way before\nDreamed of havin' so much more\n\nBIG, I do it, this goes out to my muthafucking city of Detroit\nWestside to be exact, right over there on Northlawn\n\nI been this way before\nDreamed of havin' so much more10Embed\nI been this way before\nDreamed of havin' so much more\n\nI do It\nFor the city, man\n\nFeeling like I got the cheat code to life\nJewelry looking like it got free-throwed in ice\nDebating with the Reaper not to repo my life\nCause in my 23 years I've lived a couple lives\nLike why?

admit that I need you, I need you, I need you\nNext to me\nYou said that you would ride for me\nAnd I hear you\nBut right now I need to feel you right next to me\n'Cause this is all I got, prove that you got me\n(Oh yeah) Oh yeah, yeah\n(Broken pieces)\n'Cause this is all I got, prove that you got me\n\nYeah\nSo if you say, \"Nigga,\" then I'ma say, \"Is that a Ritz?\" Mmm\nOoh, fifty niggas deep (Deep), hundred niggas step\nMillion Man March (Mmm), cracker, don't you start (Yeah)\nHold yo' head, guard yo' heart\nHold yo' head, uh\nNigga, get yo' bread, uh, light yo' spark\nStrike yo' mark, life don't stop\nSo hold yo' h\u0435ad, guard yo' heart\nHold yo' head, yeah\nYou might also like\nConflict\u0435d in this free-based world of give and take (Take)\n'Cause I always rather give than to be the one sayin' thanks (Woah)\nConflicted like bein' signed to Ye and managed by JAY\nConflicted like bein' cool with Pusha and Drake (Damn)\nConflicted like reppin' a city where I hardly stay (Stay)\nOr knowin' that you wrong but it's too hard to say\nHold yo' head (Hold yo' head), guard your heart (Guard your heart)\nIn my life, those were the hardest parts (Yeah)\nSo many dark times, I wish I caught a spark\nOr learned not seein' eye to eye could be fixed with a heart-to-heart (God)\nSo many lost, I feel lost, got me feelin' like a real nigga, Holocaust\nGot me mournin' while it's dark (Dark)\nLife'll eat you alive, we know how to be a meal\nShit, rather than see a mill', to make it out, you need a skill (Yeah)\nThought I was past my past, but let's be clear (Clear)\nObjects in the mirror are closer than they appear (Swerve)\nRegrettin' everything in life is my only fear (My only fear)\nAnd you know what they say about not conquerin' fears (What?)\nIf you don't, then they'll always be near\nAs that reminder in your ear, shit that I ain't tryna hear (Nah)\nHold yo' head (Hold yo' head), guard your heart (Guard your heart)\nIn my life, those were the hardest parts (Swerve)\nOh, you mistake me fallin' down for fallin' off (Woah)\nOr mistake me bein' soft for speakin' from the heart\nI guess life hasn't taught you as much as you thought\nInstead of pickin' up your missin' pieces, you pick me apart (God)\nBoy, hold your head but guard your heart\nGot tired of white silence, so the riots started\nAnd the robbers robbed, you wylin' 'cause yo' product gone?\nWe mad that Eric Garner, Breonna, Gianna father gone\nYeah, a lot of trauma, we tired, exhausted\nErmias the prophet said it'd be a marathon, look\nSeen all my dawgs shown me God was watchin' (Woah)\nPandemic slowin' 'em down, they fastin', Ramadan\nThe land of fifty stars, on Hollywood marchin'\nWhite friends don't got us, I promise you, I'll block 'em (Straight up)\nI'ma count my bread, I defied the odds\nAnd fuck the Saint quarterback 'cause he ain't Saint Laurent\nBoy, from here on out, we on Pyer Moss\nIf we leave Reebok, we still bring 'em pumps and all the broads\nYeah, I motivate (I motivate), I don't divide (I don't divide)\nThe 45 a coward for practicing otherwise\nA burnt nation, still it's under God\nNot gonna throw the towel in, I'm by my brother's side\nYour niggas be yo' niggas when you level up\nYou see that yo' niggas and brothers different when luck is up\nSo I trust nothing, this industry's something\nMy biggest rival is my mind protecting my thoughts\nAs well as my heart\n\nIt's fifty niggas deep, hundred niggas step\nMillion Man March, cracker, don't you start\nHold yo' head, guard yo' heart\nHold yo' head, uh\nNigga, get yo' bread, uh,

wanted\nWorking overtime, it's time I could be taking you down\nReal shit, I gotta quit acting like these niggas don't want my place\nWhen I ain't around, even though niggas ain't threats\nI know if I don't live with you, I gotta live with regrets\nI might walk in while you showering\nHit you in yo' shower cap, you gripping on the towel rack\nI'm bussin' while you buss back\nIn the bathtub pouring champagne on that ass like I'm Dame Dash\nGoddamn, yo' last nigga blew it with his lame ass\n\nBring that body to me\nBaby, come closer, closer\nBring it to me\nOh, yeah, baby, I'll give you ecstasy\nBaby, come closer, closer\nBring it to me, ooh, yeah\n\nLate night conversations, can you speak my body language?\nI ain't got no time to waste, you got me losing patience\nI can't wait to

my niggas that dreamed it than real life\u2019d it\nI swear I\u2019ve been through everything in life but a coffin\nThey say sky\u2019s the limit, how bitch?\nI\u2019m moonwalking\nAnd my middle name Michael, ho\nSuccess is my idol and being broke is my rival\nBut it\u2019s cool because I got the title, ho\nSee I just want my fantasies in real life\nYou got everything tell me what it feel like\nMotherfuck the radio if I can\u2019t hear mine\nThey give the wrong people more airtime than airlines\nIs you feeling me?\nIf not you feel my energy\nSee I know I\u2019ma make it, but even if I don\u2019t\nDon\u2019t feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had\nThose will be the best memories\n\nLet's reminisce on the good times and the bad\nBe the best memories\nI hope that you remember me\nReflect on everything we missed\nCause you know we'll never get it back\nThese will be the best memories\nWoah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories\nCause in the end all you really have is memories\nWoah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories\nYou might also like\nAre you willing to give up what you love, for who you love\nOr lose your girlfirend to groupie love\nEverywhere I go I get a group of hugs\nThat's what happens when they need connections and you the plug\nHow many trends you gotta set til you considered great?\nHow many missed calls til you considered fake?\nHow many dreams til it's considered fate?\nI\u2019m eating in a world where I\u2019m considered bait\nA workaholic addicted to bills\nPeople addicted to me cause they addicted to real\nMy best friend got addicted to pills\nI can\u2019t look at him in his eyes\nYou don\u2019t know how that shit feels mentally\nI ain't trying to rock no shirts that say in memory\nI\u2019m praying that he make it, wishing we could go back\nCause honestly all the times that we had\nThose will be the best memories\n\nLet's reminisce on the good times and the bad\nBe the best memories\nI hope that you remember me\nReflect on everything we missed\nCause you know we'll never get it back\nThese will be the best memories\nWoah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories\nCause in the end all you really have is memories\nWoah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories\nSometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed\nMailed one when I heard Unique had died in that crash\nSeems like yesterday I just seen her smile and laugh\nI'm stressing over little shit\nWhen I should be happy I can\nThey say my music beating, cause I follow my heart\nI always have faith, light will swallow the dark\nHurtin' with my Mama looking at cribs we can't purchase\nHouses bigger than the Palace\nBut she a queen, so she deserve it\nSo I'm focused, they try to throw me off track\nBut they just hurdles, I'm marathoning\nTo the money and you just running off in a circle\nI'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle\nFast forward a few years later\nNow we the fucking winner's circle\nRemember the first time I was rhyming for Kan\nAlmost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom\nSold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect\nBut I already dreamed it\nSo it felt like I rehearsed it\nMuch as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed\nSad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purses\nNo I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse\nLife out of a hearse\nAnd if I die first then I have the memories\nLet's reminisce on the good times and the bad\nBe the best memories\nI hope that you remember me\nReflect on everything we missed\nCause you know we'll never get it back\nWoah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories\nWoah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories\nLet's reminisce on the good times and the bad\nReflect on everything we missed\nCause you know

for us\nI swear this life was made for us\nNo such thing as getting paid too much\nGoing all night, please pray for us\nGoing all night, please pray for us\n\nI guess I gotta get my shit together\nI guess, I gotta get it\nI guess it's do or die now huh\nI guess I'm at the age that I can't try now huh\nI guess, I guess, I guess so\nI ain't gotta guess no more, I mean\nI mean I'm at the age that I can't even try no more\nI mean we gotta do it, it ain't even do or die no more\n\nI woke up early nigga\nI had a dream I died at thirty nigga\nAw, twenty something doing real life\nTo make a million dollars, what it feel like?\nIt feel like I need to know her right then\nIt feel like young Ray Allen with the white twins\nPopping harder than MJ with the white skin\nI take you way back, I'm talking Tommy Hilfiger\nWave cap, way back\nBack when we said we need the wrist rocky, ASAP\nI had the Casio, time to replace that\nDon't make me snap back, back to the TI$A  snapback\nKhaled with the flow, you know, they don't want you to snap, yep\nDon't make me get the car seat, niggas know I'm they pap, pap\nBoy they owe it to me like Leonardo DiCap, facts, yep\nLook fresh out of debt, getting spoiled rich\nAnd I'm just tryna spend it all with a loyal bitch\nI been choosing wrong girls my whole life\nI hope I don't fail the test again\nAnd have her going through my texts again\nReligiously, like it's the old testament\nThen end up single alone, and stressed again, saying...\nYou might also like\nI guess I gotta get my shit together\nI guess, I guess I gotta get it\nI guess it's do or die

ain't even do or die no more\n\nLook, thinking to my self what true success is\nTo some it's to get a job, retire, and move to Texas\nI take the path less travelled and give them new directions\nI'm still taking more risks than I do suggestions\nWhen I was young I was addicted to the Wrestlemania\nMaybe cause I had my back against the ropes\nAnd I grew up Stone Cold just ready to face the Undertaker\nI treat my enemies like fuckin' neighbors\nYeah you can borrow the style, and this and that for a while\nBut trust, I'll be back to fuckin' take it\nThen take it back to before it all started adding up\nBack when it was happening but wasn't happening fast enough\nAnd the job applications was the only papers stackin' up\nAnd we was contemplating black-masking out the back of trucks, yup\nDo you know how it feel, to have no chill?\nAnd love super thick girls with a supermodel feel\nAnd try and do it bigger than everyone around you ever did and ever will\nThen put it in your will\nIt ain't about where you at, boy, it's about where your mind's at\nGot my first job and realized I need two hundred times that\nI guess I gotta get my shit together\nI guess, I guess I gotta get
