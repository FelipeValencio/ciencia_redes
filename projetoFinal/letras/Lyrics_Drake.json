  "plain": "Aubrey Drake Graham (born October 24, 1986), professionally known by his middle name Drake, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor, and entrepreneur.\n\nDrake is part of a generation of rappers, along with Wiz Khalifa, Kid Cudi, and others, who came up through internet mixtapes. Drizzy put out three mixtapes from 2006 to 2009: Room for Improvement, Comeback Season, and So Far Gone. These mixtapes got him the attention of Lil Wayne, and spawned the hit singles \u201cForever\u201d and \u201cBest I Ever Had,\u201d the latter coming from his critically acclaimed mixtape So Far Gone. During this period, Drake also made a slew of guest appearances on tracks by artists from DJ Khaled to JAY-Z.\n\nEven before the release of his debut album, Drake was being referred to by Billboard as \u201cthe biggest buzz\u201d and \u201cpossibly the most sought-after artist\u201d in hip-hop. Reportedly three major labels were courting him in \u201cone of the biggest bidding wars ever.\u201d Even a New York Times article began, \u201cIf there was a time in hip-hop before Drake, it\u2019s tough to remember.\u201d Drake finally signed to Lil Wayne\u2019s Young Money Entertainment label in 2009 and his debut album Thank Me Later came out the following year. His second album, Take Care, was released in November 2011 and ultimately led to celebration with his crew for earning his first Grammy Award (for Best Rap Album). The album has been certified 4x platinum as of March 29, 2016. His third studio album, Nothing Was The Same, was released September 24th, 2013. Two years later on February 13, 2015, Drake released If You\u2019re Reading This It\u2019s Too Late. Just months after that, he released a collaborative mixtape with American rapper Future, called What A Time To Be Alive. His fourth studio album, Views, was released on April 29, 2016. Following the release of Views, Drake announced the release of his new \u201cplaylist,\u201d More Life, on OVOSOUND Radio. It was released on March 18, 2017.\n\nOn January 19, 2018, Drake surprisingly released a two-track EP, which was titled Scary Hours. In the following weeks Drake would make a song with his friend BlocBoy JB called \u201cLook Alive\u201d, the song would debut at #6 on the billboard and would mark Drake\u2019s 23rd Top 10 Billboard hit. After \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\u201d debuted and spent 11 consecutive weeks at #1 on Billboard, Drake released \u201cNice For What\u201d to continue the streak of a successful 2018. \u201cNice for What\u201d would go on to replace \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\u201d as the #1 song on the Hot 100. Drake went on to release his fifth studio album Scorpion on June 29, 2018. It featured 25 tracks and was released as a double album. Upon release, it set the single-day album streaming record on both Apple Music and Spotify and broke the first-week streaming record for an album in a mere three days. That week, a record-shattering seven songs from the album placed in the Billboard Hot 100\u2019s top ten.\n\nIn a December 25, 2019 interview with Rap Radar, Drake confirmed upcoming music. He followed this statement up by releasing two songs with Future, \u201cLife is Good\u201d and \u201cDesires,\u201d on January 10, 2020, and January 31, 2020, respectively. A month later, Drake would drop two tracks: \u201cWhen to Say When\u201d and \u201cChicago Freestyle.\u201d On April 3, 2020, Drake released \u201cToosie Slide,\u201d the first official single from his upcoming material. Dark Lane Demo Tapes, Drake\u2019s 5th official mixtape, was released on May 1, 2020, with the promise of a new studio album for summer 2020.\n\nOn October 24, 2020, Drake\u2019s 34th birthday, he revealed the album trailer for Certified Lover Boy and announced a January 2021 release date, which was postponed following a knee injury. On March 4th, 2021, Drake released Scary Hours 2, the sequel to Drake\u2019s January 2018 EP Scary Hours. The mixtape includes features from Lil Baby and Rick Ross. Certified Lover Boy finally dropped on September 3, 2021.\n\nDrizzy has also been involved in many beefs, including ones with Common, Kendrick Lamar and Tyga. His most eventful beef was with Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill. This started the whole conspiracy over \u201cDrake has a ghostwriter.\u201d Drake fired back immediately with \u201cCharged Up\u201d and with no response from Meek, he dropped another diss track four days later titled \u201cBack to Back.\u201d Meek then released his diss track titled \u201cWanna Know.\u201d. Drake was nominated for a Grammy for \u201cBest Rap Performance\u201d for \u201cBack to Back.\u201d"

Is it 'cause you livin' that bachelor life?\nProposed in 2015, but don't wanna make her your actual wife\nI'm guessin' this wedding ain't happenin', right?\n'Cause we know the girls that you actually like\nYour darkest secrets are comin' to light\nIt's all on your face like what happened to Mike\nOh shit, it's all makin' sense, maybe I'm Prince and you actually Mike\nMichael was prayin' his features would change so people believe that he's actually white\nTop would make you do features for change, get on pop records and rap for the whites\nAnd wait, you say your brother Jermaine, but you wanted him to stay out of the light\nOh shit, just follow me, right? 'Cause nothin' you sayin' could bother me, right?\nI get off the plane and nothing has changed, I head to Delilah with all of my ice\nHead to Delilah with all of my ice, head to Delilah with all of my ice\nThis shit gotta be over by now for anyone out here that's calling it, right?\nYou're dead\nYou're dead, you're dead\nThere's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to hide, you know what I mean\nThey hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact that you beat on your queen\nThe picture you painted ain't what it seem, you're dead51Embed"

Who better for you than the boy, huh?\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $118You might also like\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\nUh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures\nOr further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage\nWhen I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit\nA weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it\n'Cause that night I played her three songs\nThen we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on\nThen she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz\nBoy, was she wrong\nThat was just negative energy for me to feed off\nNow it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria\nOr Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria\nLandmarks of the muses that inspired the music\nWhen I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it\nThe one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree\nI've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me\nNow she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?\nKnow we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?\nRemember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz\nGirl, I felt like we had it all planned out\nI guess I fucked up the vision\nLearning the true consequences of my selfish decisions\nWhen you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven\nIt seem like you don't want this love anymore\nI'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore\nBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?\nWho you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\n\nBeen Baka aka Not Nice from time, G\nBeen a East Side ting\nScarborough ting from time, G\nBeen have up di ting dem from time, G\nSo I don't know what's wrong with these\nLittle wasteman out here, eh?\nY'all need to know yourself576Embed"

Time for me to revisit the past\nThere's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved\nThere's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn\nInterviews are like confessions\nGet the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $118You might also like\nDo you love this shit?\nAre you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single?\nI heard you fuck your girl, is it true?\nYou gettin' money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\n\nUh, so much for being optimistic\nThey say love is in the air, so I\nHold my breath 'til my face turn purple\nKeep a few bad bitches in my circle\nMy nuts hang like ain't no curfew\nBitch, if you wave, then I will surf you\nI flew jet, she flew commercial\nBut we still met later that night\nAfter my session, she came over\nI was aggressive and she was sober\nI gave her a pill, she started confessin'\nAnd started undressin' and asked me to hold her\nAnd so I did, but that was last month\nAnd now she's texting me asking for closure, damn\nShe say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper\nWe eat each other whenever we at the dinner table\nShe say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average\nShit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married\nPromises, I hope I never break 'em\nMet a female dragon, had a fire conversation\nBut interviews are like confessions\nGet the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like\nDo you love this shit?\nAre you high right now?\nDo you ever get nervous?\nAre you single?\nI heard you fuck your girl, is it true?\nYou gettin' money?\nYou think them niggas you with is with you?\n\nAnd I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright\nAnd we say hell yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah\nFuckin' right, damn right, alright, aw, yeah\n\nYeah\nYeah\nAw, yeah, aw, yeah\nAw, yeah, aw, yeah179Embed"

I imported mine\nBar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai\nFuck you, bitch, I'm more than high\nMy momma probably hear that and be mortified\nThis ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura\n5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside\nFor all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized\nYeah, back and forth across the borderline\nHate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime\nGone all the time, even the important times\nI should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior\nRemember?\nRemember? Motherfucker\nRemember?\nHold up, hold my phone\nThey used to never want to hear us\nRemember? Motherfucker never loved us\nRemember? Motherfucker\nRemember? Worst behavior\n383Embed"

Please don't be so ashamed\nI've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know\nThey won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real\n'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal\nAnd you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still\nSo you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase\nBig girls all get a little taste, aw\nPushing me away so I give her space, aw\nDealin' with a heart that I didn't break\nI'll be there for you, I would care for you\nI keep thinking you just don't know\nTryna run from that, say you done with that\nOn your face, girl, it just don't show\nWhen you're ready, just say you're ready\nWhen all the baggage just ain't as heavy\nAnd the party's over, just don't forget me\nWe'll change the pace and we'll just go slow\nYou won't ever have to worry\nYou won't ever have to hide\nAnd you've seen all my mistakes\nSo look me in my eyes\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $118You might also like\n'Cause if you let me\nHere's what I'll do\nI'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)\nI've loved and I've lost\n(Yeah)\n\nIt's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to\nCan't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to\n'Cause you don't say you love me\nTo your friends when they ask you\nEven though we both know that you do, you do\nOne time, been in love one time\nYou and all your girls in the club one time\nAll so convinced that you're followin' your heart\n'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes\nWe all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed\nI've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know\nYou hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one\nYou hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one\nYou love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'\nTo save you, instead, they say\n\nDon't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt\nI don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true\nDon't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt\nI don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true\nI know you've been hurt by someone else\nI can tell by the way you carry yourself\nIf you let me, here's what I'll do\nI'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)\nI've loved and I've lost181Embed"

Kelly, you could thank the Savior\nSaid if they deleted his music, then your music is goin' too, a hypocrite\nI don't understand why these people praise ya\nSoundin' like you send him commissary when he need some paper\nAlbum droppin' soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser 'stead of doin' hard labor\nNigga, I'll see you when I see you like Fantasia\nAnd Whitney, you can hit me if you need a favor\nAnd when I say I hit ya back, it's a lot safer\nHuh, I promise\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $118You might also like\nYeah\nI'm not gonna lie, this shit was, uh, some good exercise, like\nIt's good to get out, get the pen workin'\nYou would be a worthy competitor if I was really a predator\nAnd you weren't fuckin' lying to every blogger and editor, but\nIt is what it is\nYou definitely got this shit burnt the fuck out though, like\nYou got ten more records to drop\nThe one before the last one, we finessed you into tellin' a story that doesn't even exist\nAnd then, you go and drop the West Coast one to try and cover that up\nI would like that one, that w\u2014, that-that would be some shit I could dance to if you wasn't\nTriplin' down on some whole other bullshit, but\nYou know, at least your fans are gettin' some raps out of you\nI'm happy I could motivate you\nBring you back to the game, like\nYou know, but\nJust let me know when we're gettin' to the facts\nEverything in my shit is facts\nI'm waitin' on you to return the favor, like17Embed"

I should have stayed\nYou say the word, I'm on the way\nThis shit feels like teenage fever\nI'm not scared of it, she ain't either\nWhy second guess? I should have stayed\n'Cause you know what's on my mind, so\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $118You might also like\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me?\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me?\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me?\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me?\nYeah, slightly, huh, took a left turn there\nBut very much 6 a.m.\u200b\nSlightly been awake for twenty-four hours\nSo please forgive me\nMore ideas and stuff comin'\nYeah, yeah, fam, I'm wafflin'\nBut man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ72Embed"

Lipstick on the glass\nSee, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi\n\nYou must've done this before, this can't be your first time\nWe must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind\nYou got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find\nYou must've done this before, this can't be your first time (Woah)\nShower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip\nGuarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship\nAll of them ain't all equipped\nAnd this saddens me, I see the pecking order\nQuote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor\nThose that get laughed at sit off in a corner\nLike a lab rat, nobody want her\nNiggas that are married don't wanna go home\nBut we look up to them, they wish they were us\nThey want some new trim, we lust for some trust\nNow the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener\nWhich leaves your turf in a Boise state\nCan't see a play or the team, 'cause\nEverybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you\nAnd those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, \"That ain't true\"\nAll of them will have an opinion\nBut y'all know what y'all can do with them\nBut if you unsure, I'll take you on tour\nTo a place you can stick that in\nWell, sitting here sad as hell\nListening to Adele, I feel you, baby\n\"Someone Like You,\" more like someone unlike you\nOr something that's familiar maybe\nAnd I can tell that she wants a baby\nAnd I can yell, girl, that you're crazy\nOh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy\nPlease be careful, bitches got the rabies87Embed"

I got it, I'll take us wherever\nI'm a staple in the game, all my papers together\nAnd my life is on display like Truman\nThey wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner\nMy exes made some of my favorite music\nI dated women from my favorite movies\nKarma's such a thing of beauty\nI'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it\nIt's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters\nI keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever\nI might take a breather but I won't ever leave you\nIf I was you, I wouldn't like me either\nYeah42Embed"

It's so childish calling my name on the world stage\nYou need to act your age and not your girl's age\nIt gets worse by the annual\nMy career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man\nOh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah\nI know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em\nTo show they outfits off, guess they need the attention\nI remember when it used to be music that did it\nBut then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?\nI'm managed by my friends that I grew up with\nI'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with\nIf me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'\nWe'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on\nBut here we are, yeah\nLately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence\nThey scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments\nBitches alter my messages like we had words\nAnd stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve\nBitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing\nCrazy this year\u2014fuckin' with my image\nI've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year\nFuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year\nAnd I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot\n'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block\nNobody lookin' out for nobody\nMaybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody\nInstead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it\nAnd then they start to \"R.I.P.\" about it\nAnd four weeks later nobody even speaks about it\nDamn, I just had to say my piece about it\nOh, you gotta love it\u2014\nBut they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject\nI been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget\nI gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins\nShout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca\nJulia, Ericka, Southern America\nPart of my heritage, pardon my arrogance\nPart in my hair again, that's that comeback flow\nComeback flow, once I start it's apparent\nI'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'\nBut fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement\nYour content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?\nShit is gettin' so personal in your verses too\nI wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas\nBein' number two is just being the first to lose\nMy city dictated music, nobody seein' us\nWinter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up\nBeen observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough\nLet's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup\nYeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all\nYou rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all\n\"Best I Ever Had\" seems like a decade ago\nDecadent flow and I still got a decade to go\nOh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?\nWhy you rappin' like you come from the streets?\nI got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees\nAnd I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves\nPhantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease\nI cook the beef well done on the double with cheese\nSpecial order for anybody that's comin' for me\nShit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze\nYou see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me\nCuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free\nI'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat\nFeel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats\nMan, oh, you gotta love it, yeah\nAnd on top of that it's getting harder to eat\nRappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease\nTo think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me\nAnd now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe\nBut, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)\nYeah\nAnd head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)\nI know your girl well, just not in public\nBlame the city, I'm a product of it\nYoung nigga from the city\nYou gotta love it\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $118You might also like\nYeah, gotta love it\n*Laughs*\nYeah303Embed"

The do or die\nThe one with the fewest lies and the truest ties\nThey try to compare us, but\nLike a job straight outta high school there's no you and I\nI taught you everything you know, now you got student pride\nAll factual, I call the house \"the embassy\"\nThe studio \"the chapel\", I hate to travel\nI just pulled up on Sol\u00e1na show, the girl's a natural\nI knew her way back when Hollywood was international\nYeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends\nWord to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz\nVery presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential\nI broke spirits that I never meant to\nMy body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine\nAnd sleep at the opposite times\nPromise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil\nOr gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil\nViolatin' the Treaty of Versailles\nChampagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I\nI refuse to comply with regulations\nI listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence\nLike Sanders on the Detroit Lions\nGet a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya\nMotor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license\nThey tell me \"don't worry, I got your money\" like Osirus\n(I'm the Osiris of this shit)\nDirty 30, workin' on me\nTired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry\nCatering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite\nShit is nice, but I prefer Madeo\nCalamari rings and tomato\nI got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo\nWakin' up at 6 p.m. like, \"Where does the day go?\"\nForecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables\n2010 was when I lost my halo\n2017 I lost a J. Lo\nA Rotterdam trip had me on front page though\nI had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes\nClosed off but I could never stay closed\nBillboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sure\u00f1os\nBlack excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie\nThat just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't\nNiggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy\nProtection that God gave me\nShit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies\nI gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages\nI've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers\nKnowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here\nCover my ears, my security government tier\nYeah, advance the venue so we know the exits\nCheck the guest list\nIf opps make an appearance at least it's expected\nTell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace\nI'll be in better company with my own reflection\nMirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace\nThe TV playin' Al Jazeera\nInsha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer\nWhenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $118You might also like\nI love, I love\nI love, I love it\nBaby, I92Embed"
