  "plain": "Snoop Dogg rose from the streets to the suites to become arguably the most recognizable rapper in the mainstream. He has released many albums and mixtapes\u2014ranging from gangsta rap to reggae to gospel\u2014and he has made many film and television appearances in his decades-long multimedia career. Outside of the media, Snoop is also a youth football coach with his own league and he also has multiple business ventures, which includes owning and running Death Row Records, the record label that gave him his start in the music business.\n\nSnoop Dogg was born Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. on October 20, 1971 in Long Beach, California. As a child, he was nicknamed \u201cSnoopy\u201d due to his likeness of the canine character from the Peanuts cartoons. Snoop grew up in the church as he sang and played the piano there before getting into rapping. During his teenage years, Snoop became affiliated with the Rollin' 20s Crips from Eastside Long Beach and was arrested several times, leading him to seek a new path in life.\n\nSnoop began making demo tapes with his cousin Nate Dogg and their friend Warren\u00a0G, and the crew called themselves 213 to match Long Beach\u2019s area code at the time. Their name was inspired by the group 415 from Oakland and the group\u2019s lead rapper Richie Rich was an influence on Snoop\u2019s laidback rap style. Warren G was able to get one of the demo tapes into the hands of his stepbrother, producer Dr. Dre, who helped Snoop Doggy Dogg become a household name.\n\nSnoop\u2019s introduction came in the spring of 1992 on Dr. Dre\u2019s single \u201cDeep Cover.\u201d A few months later, Snoop\u2019s star began to rise with his appearance on Dr. Dre\u2019s \u201cNuthin' But a G Thang\u201d and The Chronic album, leading into the highly anticipated release of his debut album Doggystyle in 1993. The album debuted in the number one spot on the Billboard 200 with over 800,000 records sold in its first week and it went on to sell over 11 million copies worldwide. The Chronic and Doggystyle are hailed as two of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time as they helped further popularize West Coast gangsta rap and the G-Funk sound.\n\nIn the summer of 1993, while working on Doggystyle, Snoop was charged with first degree murder along with his bodyguard McKinley Lee in the death of gang member Philip Woldemariam. This incident inspired the track \u201cMurder Was the Case,\u201d which was later made into a short film with an accompanying soundtrack released in 1994. Snoop and Lee were acquitted of all charges in February 1996, which Snoop celebrated with new Death Row labelmate 2Pac on his single \u201c2 of Amerika'z Most Wanted.\u201d\n\nAfter working on Tha Dogg Pound\u2019s Dogg Food album in 1995, Snoop was working on his sophomore album, Tha Doggfather. Prior to the album\u2019s November 1996 release, Death Row experienced two major blows with the departure of Dr. Dre for his own Aftermath Entertainment and the death of 2Pac on September 13, 1996. Despite the drama, Tha Doggfather also debuted atop the Billboard 200 and sold millions of copies. That would be the last Snoop Doggy Dogg album as he escaped Death Row in 1998 to sign with Master P\u2019s No Limit Records.\n\nSnoop would go on to record for several labels, releasing multiple platinum albums and singles, including his collaborations with The Neptunes and Pharrell Williams on the 2003 single \u201cBeautiful\u201d and the 2004 single \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot.\u201d Snoop also released a few group projects, including two albums with Tha Eastsidaz (2000\u2019s Snoop Dogg Presents Tha Eastsidaz and 2001\u2019s Duces \u2018N Trayz\u2026The Old Fashioned Way), one album with his 213 crew with 2004\u2019s The Hard Way, 2013\u2019s 7 Days of Funk with D\u00e2m-Funk, a 2016 album with his cousin Daz Dillinger entitled Cuzznz, and in 2022, he released the MOUNT WESTMORE supergroup project Bad MF\u2019s with Ice Cube, E-40 and Too $hort. He also collaborated with a wide range of artists, including Willie Nelson, Gorillaz, and Katy Perry among others. Snoop also ventured outside of rap, releasing the reggae album Reincarnated in 2013 under the name Snoop Lion, and he also released the gospel album Bible of Love in 2018.\n\nSnoop has appeared in a number of films, including Half Baked, Baby Boy, Training Day, and he starred in The Wash with Dr. Dre. He has also made a number of television appearances as himself, as well as hosting the game show The Joker\u2019s Wild and forming an odd couple partnership with Martha Stewart, which resulted in the VH1 show Martha & Snoop\u2019s Potluck Dinner Party as well as a collaborative cookbook. He has also been a sports commentator for boxing, hockey, wrestling, and he even served as an Olympics analyst with Kevin Hart.\n\nSnoop has a number of business ventures, including establishing his Snoop Youth Football League in 2005\u2014which has produced several NFL players\u2014as well as doing deals within the marijuana industry, investing in Reddit and owning space in the Metaverse.\n\nSnoop has sold millions of albums and won numerous awards since his 1992 debut. He was inducted into the Celebrity Wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2016 for his multiple appearances and he was awarded with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2018. 2022 may have been the most eventful year of his career as he shared the stage with Dr. Dre, Mary J. Blige, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, and 50 Cent in a historic headlining performance during the Super Bowl LVI halftime show at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. This performance would later land them all an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Variety Special category. Prior to the show, it was announced that Snoop would release his album BODR\u2014Bacc on Death Row\u2014symbolizing Snoop\u2019s full circle moment of acquiring the rights and becoming the owner of Death Row Records."

You really don't know\nSo I'd advise you not to trust that ho\nSilly of me to fall in love with a bitch\nKnowin' damn well I'm too caught up with my grip\nNow as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger (Uh-huh)\nHow many bitches wanna fuck this nigga\nNamed Snoop Doggy? I'm all the above\nI'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes\nBut see, it ain't no fun\nIf my homies can't get a taste of it, 'cause you know I don't love it\nWoo! Hey, now you know\nInhale, exhale with my flow\nOne for the money, two for the bitches\nThree to get ready, and four to hit the switches\nIn my Chevy, '64 red, to be exact\nWith bitches on my side, and bitches on my back\nSo back up, bitch, because I'm strugglin'\nJust get on your knees, and then start jugglin'\nThese motherfuckin' nuts in your mouth\nIt's me, Warren G, the nigga with the clout (Woo)\n\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none\nIt ain't no fun if the homies can't have none48Embed"

Eternal life and forever\nAnd will I be the G that I was?\nI'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of\nSo relax your soul, let me take control\nClose your eyes, my son, my eyes are closed\n\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me\nI'm fresh up out my coma\nI got my Mama and my Daddy and my homies in my corner\nIt's gonna take a miracle they say\nFor me to walk again and talk again, but anyway\nI get fronted some ki's to get back on my feet\nAnd everything that nigga said came to reality\nLiving like a baller loc\nHaving money and blowing hella chronic smoke\nI bought my Mama a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag\nAnd now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad\nJust remember who changed your mind\n'Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine\nIndeed, agreed, proceed to smoke weed\nNever have a want, never have a need\nThey say I'm greedy but I still want more\n'Cause my eyes wanna journey some more, really though (Check it out)\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nI pray the Lord, my soul to keep\nIf I should die before I wake\nI pray the Lord, my soul to take\n\nNo more indo, gin and juice\nI'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose\nShackled from head to toe\nTwenty-five with an izzel, with nowhere to gizzo, I know\nThem niggas from the other side recognize my face\n'Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C\nMad dogging niggas 'cause I don't care\nRed jumpsuit with two braids in my hair\nNiggas stare as I enter the center\nThey send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay\nLate night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor\nNiggas getting they shanks, just in case the war\nPops off, 'cause you can't tell what's next\nMy little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck\nAnd he probably won't make it to see twenty-two\nI put that on my Mama, I'ma ride for you, Baby Boo\n\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me\nMurder\nMurder was the case that they gave me33Embed"

Ayo, what's up with the crew?\nIs them niggas in jail, or are them niggas through?\"\nI said, \"If you ain't up on thangs\nSnoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the gang\"\nIt's like this, they don't understand\nIt's an everyday thang to gangbang\nMake that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggas know\nWhat's up with you? I represent the Pound and Death Row\nAnd can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach\nOr Compton and Watts see D-O-Gs, now\nYou can't come and you can't run, and you can't\nSee long to the G of the gang, one gun\nIs all that we need to put you to rest\n(Pump-pump) Put two slugs dead in your chest\nNow you dead then a motherfucker creeping and sleeping\nSix feet deep in, fucking with the Pound is\nYou might also like\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\n\nThe cloud becomes black and the sky becomes blue\nNow you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew\nAin't no clue on why the fuck we do what we do\nLeave you in a state of paranoia, ooh\nDon't make a move for your gat so soon\n'Cause I drops bombs like Platoon (Ayy, nigga)\nWalk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you\nI'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you (I won't leave you)\nUntil you get the full comprehension\nAnd when you do, that's when the mission\nOr survival becomes your every thought\nKeep your eyes open, 'cause you don't wanna be caught\nHalf-stepping with your weapon on safety\nNow break yourself, motherfucker, 'fore you make me\nTake this 211 to another level\nI come up with your ends, you go down with the Devil\nNow roam through the depths of Hell\nWhere the rest your busta-ass homeboys dwell, well\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nNow tell me, what's my motherfuckin' name?\nSerial killa\nSerial killa\nSerial killa\nWake up in the morning, eat your Lucky Charms cereal\n\nDeep, deep like the mind of Minolta\nNow picture this\nLet's picnic inside a morgue\nNot pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets\nAnd I got the machine to crack your fuckin' chest plate\nOpen and release them guts\nThen I release def cuts\nBrutal, jagged edged, totally roughneck\nNow everybody scream, 'nuff respect to the X\n'Nuff respect given\nDisrespect and you will not be living\nWord to mama and my drama, dilemma\n\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nSuicide, it's a suicide\nNow tell me, what's my motherfuckin' name?\nSerial killa\nSerial killa\nSerial killa\nWake up in the morning, eat your Lucky Charms cereal13Embed"

Roof! Roof! Roof! Roof!\n\nI'm sippin' on Tanqueray\nWith my mind on my money and my mouth fulla' gan-jay\nR-A-G to the motherfuckin' E\nBack with my nigga S-N-double-O-P\nYeah, and ya don't stop\nRage in effect, I just begun to rock\nI said, yeah, and ya don't quit\nHey-yo, Rage, would you please drop some gangsta shit?\nI rock rough and stuff with my afro puffs\nHandcuffed as I bust, 'bout to tear shit up\nOh, what? Did ya think I, didn't ever think I\nWould be the one to make you blink eye, I'm catchy like pink-eye\nNever will there ever be another like me, um\nYou can play the left 'cause it ain't no right in me\nOut the picture, out the frame, out the box I knock 'em all\nSmack 'em out the park, like \"A Friendly Game of Baseball\"\nGrand slam, yes, I am\nKickin' up dust and I don't give a goddamn\n'Cause I'm that lyrical murderer pleading guilty\nYou know from my skills I'm about to be\nFilthy, large, Rage in charge\nYou know what's happenin', don't try to play Raj\nThis ain't no re-run, see, hun, don't you wanna be one?\nHowever, Rage'll wreck ya 'cause I'm def\nI kick my vocals, I loc yo, coast to coast or local, uh!\nI'll make 'em go coo-coo for my Cocoa\nPuffin' stuff, ayo, Snoop, you're up\nLet these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck\nYou might also like\nThis is just a small introduction to the G-funk era\nEveryday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror\nAnd I see motherfuckers tryna be like me\nEver since I put it down with the D-R-E\n\nFoamin' at the mouth and waggin' his tail\nSearchin through the yard with a keen sense of smell\nLookin' for the bitches in heat\nAnd when he find it he'll be sniffin her seat\nWe travel in packs and we do it from the back\nHow else can you get to the booty?\nWe do it doggystyle\nAll the while we do it doggystyle\nYo motherfuckin' hoe!\nHe fucked the fleas off the bitch, he shaked the ticks off his dick\nAnd in the booty, he buries his motherfuckin' bone\nAnd if there's any left over, he'll roll over and take a doggy bag home\n\nDamn, that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga\nI ain't bullshittin', one of y'all niggas gotta get it\nMan, I got to piss\nBreath test?11Embed"

(Ho ho ho ho)\nI want a Super 'Intendo (Merry Christmas!), yeah\nSega Genesis (Mommy, mommy), yeah\nStreet Fighter 2 (Mommy, is that the Black Santa Claus?)\nAnd a gang of toys (That is the Black Santa Claus!), uh\nMommy, mommy, mommy\n\nIt's 12:30 a.m., Christmas Eve\nI'm out with the gangstas and thieves\nCelebratin', postin' up with eggnog head up-up in my cup\nPut Rudolph in motion, sleigh all bang-bangin' and coastin'\nDown the block, but be careful for the hawk because it's posted\nSome stay to this day that Christmas ain't nothing but another day\nBut, out of respect, I gotta give the Lord his day\nTell me, tell me, where do the homeless and bums got to sleep? (Nowhere)\nWhere do hungry and the needy-greedies got to eat? (But who cares?)\nLife is so crucial and cold, as for, for the children\nIn this world they hopes and dreams can't unfold\nThe young and old churches, the spiritual dreams, seasonal things\nHeard throughout the ghetto, reaches gangstas and dope fiends, huh\n'Cause those who ain't able get it now can finally get it\n'Cause the ghetto Santa Claus has sprinkled the hood, now we ballin'\nLivin' to a new year of better thangs\nCelebrate it with some Champagne, haha, check it (Yeah)\nYou might also like\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\n\nNow on the first day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me\nA sack of the Krazy Glue and told me to smoke it up slowly\nNow on the second day of Christmas, my homeboy gave to me\nA fifth of Henn-dawg and told me to take my mind off that weed\nNow by the third day of Christmas, my big homeboy gave to me\nA whole lot of everything, and it wasn't nothin' but game to me\n\nBack then, you woke up to the sound of \"I Saw Mama Kissing Santa\"\nMade you reminisce on the old fashion Christmas days\nGifts, Mr. Fat Man jolly with joy\nDown ya chimney with toys for lil' girls and boys\nPumped up, I jumped up before the sun peeped in\nAnd hoped to catch a Santa Claus creepin' down my hall\nRun to the window, put my eyes to the sky\nTo see if I could see the sleigh that parlayed and pushed a fat guy\nI sigh, ain't no sign, but everything under this tree in my house is mine\nMy bike, that, and this plastic nine'll do fine 'til next year come\nI try to see the same thing, they got us brainwashed dumb\nAnd when you find it ain't no Santa, Christmas still mean a lot\n'Cause it's the time to get together and give all you got\nYou got food, good moods, and what's better than together with your people\nWell-wishers give a toast by the tree, it's Merry Christmas\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh, don't get too close because you might get shot)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto (Welcome to the ghetto)\n\nSanta Claus on the ceiling, Jack Frost chillin'\nPinch the Grinch for being a holiday villain\nSeason's greetings, all the proceedings\nAre brought to you by the church house where we'll be eatin'\nChestnuts roastin' on a open fire\nSingin' my jingle, where is Kris Kringle?\nI didn't pout and I ain't even shouted\nI even stayed in the house when the homies tried to sneak me out\nAnd all I want for Christmas is my six-four Chevrolet\nAnd a granddaughter for her grandmother Beverly\nAin't that somethin'? (Uh-huh) Nah, ain't that nothin'\nHow it's Christmas time and my rhyme's steady bumpin'\nEverybody happy (Happy), hair still nappy\nGonna steal a gift for my old grandpappy\nCatch me giving out turkeys at the church house\nDon't try to work me, just stand in line and everything gon' be fine\nHolla at ya folks, boy, it's goin' down\nAin't no help from no elves, just Tha Dogg Pound\nAnd we passin' out gifts, blazin' up spliffs\nChristmas on the Row, can you dig it? (Can you dig it?)\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\n\nChristmas Eve, I believe '76 was the year\nGirls and boys full off joy with the season cheer\nSmell the sky, hella pies and cakes gettin' baked\nTo be ate after everything gone off your plate\nBut wait, not tonight it's straight beans and rice\nOn the table, are we able to proceed tonight?\nI wonder what the morn bringin' so it's hard to doze off\nThree 'o clock in my socks I crack the door soft\nHopin' when I open the door I'll see Santa\nNow who the hell is this in this blue bandana?\nMessin' with the boxes that's up under the tree\nLook like Santa Claus done crossed into a woman to me\nNow I'm comin' to see the whole picture gettin' clearer\nHow we have less as X-Mas get nearer\nMirror, mirror, please, it's seemed I've been deceived\nAnd thank you, Saint Trick, for the gifts I received\nSo I creep back, and act like I ain't even peeped it\nThis'll be me and mom's private secret\n\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\n\nWe wish you a happy new year\nWe wish you a happy new year\nWe wish you a happy new year\nWe wish you a happy new year\n\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto\nSanta Claus (Ooh-ooh-ooh)\nIs coming straight to the ghetto4Embed"

This is Snoop Dogg\nI'm tryin' to figure out how the fuck I'ma do y'all\nHangin' with my homie from the turf, that's young Q-Ball\nGivin' me the word on the streets, here's the scoop, y'all\nThe niggas from Tha Eastsidaz split up (Split up)\nAnd one of 'em tried to fuck your shit up (What?)\nNah cuz, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life\nI'm out with the bullshit, I'm in with the real shit\nI'm at the church doing work, spittin' game from the pulpit\nNow that's the business, and God as my witness\nLBC, 213, hell yeah, we in this\nIt's so relentless and all my dogs up against the life sentence\nI love y'all like I love no bitch and that's real shit\nOn some Crip shit, homie, dig this\nYou might also like\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\n\nI used to have a lot of broads that I don't fool with\nI used to have a lot of homeboys I ain't cool with\nA lot of people that a nigga went to school with\nHappy as hell to see the big dog doin' it\nBut wouldn't none of them believe it though (What?)\nThat I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow\nI guess he was right, these are the breaks\nDespite my mistakes and aches, I'm getting cake\nTo realize your fate through faith\n'Cause we all gon' get that day (For what?)\nTo see if our life was straight\nAnd see if we'll be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)\nTo see the man upstairs\nOn some real talk, homie, I'm tired of bein' stuck here\nIf I could, I would fly to the moon (Zoom)\nY'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms, I know\n\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\nThere will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns\nShare with me, fairy tales are make-believe\nNow, as I think back to the words my granddaddy used to say\nI never seen him in church, but he always had the word\nHe always would tell me, \"Sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad\nYou got to do bad in order to do good\"2Embed"

Lyrics\nNine in the mornin', feds at my door (My door)\nBlue Cortez squeakin' 'cross the hardwood floor (Right)\nDippin' through the alley I made my escape\nDidn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape\nMad with no music but happy 'cause free\nBailin' fast as I can bail down 19th Street\nI got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand\nGold on my neck, my pistol's close in hand\nI'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC\nRemotely controlled by the bomb E.T\nBut just livin' in Beach city is a serious task\nDidn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask\n\nWe're comin' with that G shit, that C shit that makin' niggas sick\nHow does it feel to see a G from your clique?\nWake up, jumped out of bed with my grin on (Why?)\nLast night's dice game, got my win on\nAbout a G and a half is what I came with\nBut twenty-five G's is what I left with\nTee-lee was the word I heard\nI went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the curb\nGimme the dice so I can break you niggas\nI threw a six (C-I-X) so my point was the biggest\nSeven, four, four, tre back to back\nI sent two fools back to they 'Leezzac\nYou might also like\nSee now I'm off to the graveyard shift\nAnd I gotsta pay my dues to make my grip\nBut I chill 'cause my ho might call\nAin't no thang, 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall\nAnd I takes a quick walk up the block\nWith my Glock cocked, ready to make a stop where I set up shop\nOn Fifty-nina, 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin'\nThat's where a nigga'll be slangin'\nI'm makin' a cool grip of shit, this ain't me\nSo I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki\nAnd now the shop's on deck\nAnd everything that's mines I protect with a Tec, I don't half step\nNow I got ends\nAnd I'm rollin' a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends\nBut I could only trust a few\nAnd unawarely I trusted you\nBut if I only knew\n\nG and Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin' get-go\nDevoted and quotin', back in '84\nI was thirteen, G was a year older\nBut I still wasn't afraid to throw 'em from the shoulders\nGettin' put on the hood was the anticipation\nAnd yeah, King Park was the destination\nEvery nigga that I knew was at the park that night\nEven the smokers that be lovin' to get sparked at night\nBack on the streets, straight blue and gray\n'Cause I represent like every day\nNigga, you can't tell me I don't be on the spot\nWhen I can tell you all the homies that done got shot\nFrom at least about five years ago\nWhen I was in junior high goin' to Marshall\nThe homie use to come up to the school and rock\nAnd leave and have the bitches flockin' his jock\nDamn, them was the days of the past\nBut since the Pizzound formed, we been whippin' people's ass\nAnd everybody'll blast\nAnd if you don't believe me, nigga, you can ask the homie Daz\nAnd that's your ass\nFucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (Haha)\nHe didn't even run, he walked away (Busta)\nCuz, I lived to see that day\nI wished I was there, I woulda clowned\nBut that's why we \"x\"-ed your bitch ass from the Pound\n'Cause he wouldn't even squab back\nMan, we can't fuck with no niggas like that\nHe'll get us all cracked\nIf the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap\nNow that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!)\nI second the motion, you was dropped from the clique (Yeah, yeah)\nSome of these nigga are bitches, too\nAnd some of these niggas look just like you\nSo if you've ever been told on\nGo out and get your roll on\nYou punk ass nigga, you gettin' stole on\n\nIt's 5:30 in the mornin', now I'm yizzawnin'\nNow as I proceed to get G to a tee\nAnd before I bail to school, you know I blaze up a sack\nAnother day to clock a dollar for the gangsta mack\nBitch, act like you know, show me some sex and affection\nAnd lick me down slow\nFlossin', tossin' a bitch (Bitch)\nYeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention\nShoot five niggas, shoot ten\nShoot the pink slip to your Benz\nSeven, goddamn it, win again\nA six and four for the hundred, straight four for a G\nYoung Daz, little nigga, you can't fuck with me\n\nNow I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you\nSo what made them niggas try to spit at you?\nDisrespect the game then snitch on you\nY'all punk ass niggas, man, y'all some bitches, too\n\nWho got some gangsta gangsta shit? (Haha)\nSwoop G, I heard somebody's speakin' up on me\n'Cause when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes\nJust boulders, ounces, half ounces and quarter pieces\nSee, it's the season and I don't smoke bunk\nIt's either indo or skunk, I might as well get drunk\nThan smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest\nI only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up\nMy hood is gettin' hot and niggas is tryna plot and\nCome up off a young nigga callin' his shots\nSwoop G ain't the one, I do what's to be done (Ah)\nAlways have my gun and my G from 2-1 (Ah, ah)\nIn Cerritos, but you don't hear me though\n'Cause you don't really know about the you-know\nOn Cerritos, silly ho\nSwoop G, motherfuckin' LBC\nNone of these nigga wanna fuck with me (Ah)\nSwoop G (Ah, ah, ah)\nG, G3Embed"

You know,\u2005there's\u2005a lot of\u2005people that didn't, like, really appreciate\u2005the Unity Walk yesterday. Don't like peace and all that, and I understand. When I was out there, I didn't understand it either. They couldn't talk peace with me. They tried, and I was like, \"Nigga, that's schoolyard.\" You can't find a home in my generation that put in more work than me. You may find one or two that put in as much as me, but you ain't gon' find none that put in more than me. And I'm here to tell you that shit was worthless, bro. When they try to peace, I don't wanna peace. Look where I'm at. This shit ain't cool, bro. Crazy part of this, you go this way to me, two steps that way, you got 60s.

Then I got plenty of flowers to blow\nSmoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong\nDon't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song\nAnd do it however you please, you please\nToday's the day to smoke weed\nYou might also like\nSo go ahead and blaze up\nToday's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)\nSo go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana\n\nDamn, a pound ain't really nothing now\nRemember smoking with my cousin\nNow we all Raw cone stuffing\nEnough to wake neighbors up\nKK my favorite flavor\nAnd you ain't gotta ask cause we major\nI smoke like them old players\nOnly put it in the paper\nI just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me\nKnown to keep the room cloudy\nGet a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open\nThe best trees I be smoking\nSmell it through the bag so it's potent\nEven get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice\nRan in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it\nA pothead but I be focused\nAnd it ain't in my session if it's bullshit\nOnly the best what you dealing with\nIt's legal now, everybody's doing this\nSo go ahead and blaze up\nToday's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)\nSo go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana\nGo ahead and blaze up\nToday's the day to blaze up\nSo go ahead and put your J's up\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana\nNa-na-na-na-na-nanana na\n\nCome and smoke with me tonight, tonight1Embed"

C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg)\n\nBam, boom, what you gon' do, cuz?\nGuess who rollin' in, with them baby blue Chucks?\nAnd I've still got my khakis creased\nI'm still loc'n on these beats and keep a bad bitch on the streets\nIt's the S-N-double-O-P'n\nBiggest dogg of 'em all, and youse a flea'n\nAnd since I got time to drop it for you, I guess I must\nAnd give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust\nI keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust\nAnd can't none of y'all fuck with us\nBut you can run up on the G, but that's not thinkin' wisely\nThese thrillers are \"Contagious\", just like Ron Isley\nWhat the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin' in my home\nSnoop to the D-O-Double G (Uh-huh)\nGet in where you fit in, follow me (Ooh)\n\nWho's the man with that dance? (Snoop Dogg)\nWho keep the khakis for all his pants? (Snoop Dogg)\nKeep the low-low in a three-wheel stance (Snoop Dogg)\nStill got the \"Gin and Juice\" in hand (Snoop Dogg)\nYou might also like\nI do it for the G's and I do it for the hustlers\nHere to annihilate you mark-ass busters\nEff the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us\nThe world is fuckin' chilly as if his name was Usher\nBut I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin them G stacks\nAnd got them cornrows to the back\nI ain't really tryin to be picky\nBut if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky\nGreen by the ounces, low-lows bouncin\nSandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin on my couch and\nOoh to the ouch and, Moet fountain\nThat's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n\nThis year we ain't fuck with thousands\nWe clean with millions that get fly as a falcon\nPull up to the Doggy Dogg palace\nWith a car fulla bitches cookin grits like Alice (ooh!)\n\nWho's the man with that dance? (Snoop Dogg)\nWho keep the khakis for all his pants? (Snoop Dogg)\nKeep the low-low in a three-wheel stance (Snoop Dogg)\nStill got the \"Gin and Juice\" in hand (Snoop Dogg)\n\nThree 14-inch rims are running on the side\n(They're riding on the side?)
