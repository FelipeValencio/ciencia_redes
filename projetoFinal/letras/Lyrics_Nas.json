  "plain": "Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones, known to one and all as Nas, is one of hip-hop\u2019s best-known, most mercurial, and lyrically blessed figures ever to touch the microphone. Since his heart-stopping debut turn on Main Source\u2019s \u201cLive at the Barbeque,\u201d Nas has delivered countless beautifully structured, thought-provoking, keenly observed verses.\n\nGrowing up in Queensbridge, NY, Nas never really performed in big crowds\u2014he kept to himself. Nas used a different type of vernacular that others didn\u2019t understand, which helped him to stand out from other rappers from his era.\n\nA passion for music struck with Nas at an early age, too. His father, Olu Dara made a successful career as a blues musician, while Nas began recording his own material at just 16 years old.\n\nWith every ensuing album, Nas always reminds fans that he\u2019s still the same Queensbridge MC who crafted one of the greatest musical albums of all time, and the bible of Hip-Hop, Illmatic. His second album, It Was Written, built on his well-established success, and is his most commercially accomplished, with over 3 million copies sold and certified triple platinum status. In addition, numerous other releases, such as I Am\u2026, Stillmatic, and God\u2019s Son have drawn universal praise and appreciation from around the Hip-Hop world.\n\nNas established the Nasir Jones Hiphop Fellowship at Harvard University to fund artists who demonstrate exceptional productivity and creative ability in hip-hop."

State of Mind Lyrics\n\nYeah, yeah\nAyo, Black\u2014it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)\nYeah, it's time, man (Aight, man, begin)\nYeah\u2014straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap\nWhere fake niggas don't make it back\nI don't know how to start this shit, yo\u2014now;\nRappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'\nMusician, inflictin' composition of pain\nI'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine\nHoldin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme\nNow, bullet holes left in my peepholes\nI'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a .9 and I'll defeat foes\nY'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay\nI keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway\nOr either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs\nLaughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps\nG-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit\nReminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped\nNiggas be runnin' through the block shootin'\nTime to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston\nOnce they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and\nI ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin\nPicked the MAC up, told brothers \"Back up!\" \u2014 the MAC spit\nLead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip\nHeard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look\nGave another squeeze, heard it click, \"Yo, my shit is stuck!\"\nTried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger\nFinally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber\nSo, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby\nAnd it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be\n(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same\nGot younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name\nAnd claim some corners, crews without guns are goners\nIn broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us\n.45\u2019s and gauges, MAC's in fact\nSame niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks\nIn black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked\nSo hold your stash 'til the coke price drop\nI know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock\nAnd if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots\nBut yo, you gotta slide on a vacation\nInside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'\nIt drops deep as it does in my breath\nI never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death\nBeyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined\nI think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind\nYou might also like\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nBe havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Mo\u00ebts, holdin' TEC's\nMakin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped\nInvestments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks\nWinnin' gunfights with mega-cops\nBut just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger\nMake enough figures until my pockets get bigger\nI ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'\nGive me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'\nThinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter\nWhenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta\nIn the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays\nYoung bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze\nFull of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed\nFrom what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back\nBlack, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black\nThe fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back\nAnd lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn\nOr the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes\nI got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane\nLife is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain\nAnd be prosperous, though we live dangerous\nCops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages\nIt's only right that I was born to use mics\nAnd the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes\nI'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow\nMy rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule\nThe smooth criminal on beat breaks\nNever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes\nThe city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps\nThat's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks\nI'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers\nIn the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya\nInhale deep like the words of my breath\nI never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death\nI lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times\nNothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\nNew York state of mind\n\n\"Nasty Nas\u2014\"442Embed"

(Nas, Nas, Nas)\nYou might also like\nNas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like... half-man, half-amazin' (Uh)\nNo doubt!\nNas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel (Uh, uh)\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like... half-man, half-amazin' (Uh)\nNo doubt! (Uh)\n\n(Nas is like...) Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires\nBulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver\nPlanets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars\nTarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas\n(Nas is like...) Iron Mike, messiah type\nBefore the Christ, After the Death, the last one left\nLet my cash invest in stock\nCame a long way from blastin' TEC's on blocks\nWent from Seiko to Rolex, ownin' acres\nFrom the projects with no chips, to large cake dough\nDimes givin' fellatio, siete zeros\nBet my 9 spit for the pesos\nBut what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth\nRich men died and tried, but none of it worked\nThey just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid\nBefore my number's called, history's made\nSome'll fall, but I rise \u2014 thug or die\nMakin' choices that determine my future under the sky\nTo rob, steal or kill, I'm wonderin' why\nIt's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?\nMuch success to you, even if you wish me the opposite\nSooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is\nNas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like... half-man, half-amazin' (C'mon)\nNo doubt!\nNas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like... half-man, half-amazin'\nNo doubt! (Uh)\n\n(Nas is like...) Sex to a nympho, but nothin' sweet\nI'm like beef, bustin' heat through your windows\nI'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather\nLike Greeks in Egypt, learnin' somethin' deep from they teachers\nI'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for\nAlways got you, I\u2019m like Pac, dude you would cry for\nI'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money\nCorporate accounts from a rich company\nI'm like ecstasy for ladies\nI'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam\nBulletproof Hummer man\nI'm like bein' locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam\nI'm the feelin' of a millionaire spendin' a hundred grand\nI'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet\nLive it and I write down, and I watch it blow up\nY'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now\nNas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like... half-man, half-amazin'\nNo doubt!\nNas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel\nMy poetry's deep, I never fell\nNas is like... half-man, half-amazin'\nNo doubt!

This hood politics\nAcknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages\nSeeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us\nPolice watch us, roll up and try knockin' us\nOne knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?\nBut my luck, I got up, the cop shot again\nBus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken\nRicochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in\nBlackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit\nThis is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it\n'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown\nHoodrats, don't abortion your womb\nWe need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon\nIn this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers\nStick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors\nIf you really think you ready to die with nines out\nThis is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now\nYou might also like\nYo, all I need is one mic\nAll I need is one mic (That's all I need)\nAll I need is one mic (All I need, niggas)\nAll I need is one mic (Yeah)\n\nAll I need is one blunt, one page and one pen\nOne prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin\nMatter fact, maybe more than one\nLook back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them\nJesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots\nFrom twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two\nWhich means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen\nTwenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you\nEverybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral\nNever gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent\nNothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs\nMy heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air\nI let this shit slide for too many years, too many times\nNow I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines\nIf y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis\nDo more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty\nThere's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush\nLead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut\nThat we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down\n'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now\nAll I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)\nAll I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)\nAll I need is one mic (That's all a nigga need to do his thing, you know?)\nAll I need is one mic (This is all I need)\n\nAll I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man\nWhat I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand\nDon't wanna see me on top, too egotistical\nTalkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do\nWonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you\nOnly if they know what your weakness is, I have none\nToo late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga\nThought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas\nWhat you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'\nWar gets deep, some beef is everlastin'\nComplete with thick scars\nBrothers knifin' each other up in prison yards\nDrama, where does it start?\nYou know the block was ill as a youngster\nEvery night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster\nFor real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name\nJealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained\nBitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished\nShoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence\nDiamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes\nMovin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight\nSwellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real\nHeard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?\nThis is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found\nYou need some soul-searchin', the time is now\nAll I need is one mic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\nAll I need is one mic (All I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)\nAll I need is one mic (Fuck the cars, the jewelry)\nAll I need is one mic (To spread my voice to the whole world, baby)56Embed"

Older niggas was gettin' mad\nBut that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad\nAt least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats\nAnd it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great\nNigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face\nThey took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes\nAnd when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame\nSo point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same\nThe first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures\nA big difference between 'em but I get why you said it\nRadio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warnin'\nGlobal warmin' to that cold world you was breathin'\nThat's some advice I never got\nIf I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock\nWhile you was writin' down my rhymes I was just tryna show you\nThat if you say what's on ya mind, you can stand the test of time\nNow I'm playin' Born Sinner loud, saw you live, rock the crowd\nLike wow, you made your nigga Nas proud\nYou might also like\nSo you ain't let Nas down\nIt's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga\nYou ain't let Nas down\nHow that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothin', nigga\nYou ain't let Nas down\n\nLong live the idols, may they never be your rivals\nSlick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible\nNow what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin\nLarge Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end, ah53Embed"

Let's go\n\nYou can hate me now (Q.B.)\nBut I won't stop now (Real niggas)\n'Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts)\nYou can hate me now (C'mon)\nBut I won't stop now (Uh)\n'Cause I can't stop now\nYou can hate me now\nYou can hate me now\n\nWell, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too\nIt's as simple as that\nDie motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!\nYou don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck\nGo down any way you want it to go down\nYou might also like\nDo it now\nWeak, jealous motherfuckers!\nDo it now, do it now!\n\nDon't hate me, hate the money I see (Yeah), clothes that I buy (Uh-huh)\nIce that I wear, flows that I try (C'mon)\nClose your eyes (That's right), picture me rollin' sixes, money foldin'\nBitches, honeys that's swollen, the riches, Nas get in ya\nMost critically acclaimed, Pulitzer Prize winner\nBest storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater (You the best, that's right)\nModel dater, big threat to a lot of you haters (Haha)\nCommentators ringside try watchin' my paper (Watch this)\nAlmost a decade, quite impressive\nMost of the best is in the essence, for this rap shit that I stand for\nExpandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gate dreams\nBut it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens (Hah, picture that)\nWant me off the scene fast, but good things last\nLike your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash\nFirst rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects\nBut you still wanna hate? Be my guest, I suggest \u2013\n\nMoney is power, motherfucker\nI got millions of thugs on salary!\nDo it now!\nYou can hate me now (I won't stop)\nBut I won't stop now (I can't stop)\n'Cause I can't stop now (Now) (You can hate me)\nYou can hate me now (Do it now) (I hate you too)\nBut I won't stop now (C'mon) (You can hate me now)\n'Cause I can't stop now (C'mon)\nYou can hate me now (Do it now) (You can hate me now)\nYou can hate me now\n\nDo it now!

Funny, I was just like you\nI had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it\nNow y'all sayin': \"Nas a clever nigga, nothin' to play with\"\nHate on me, I blew, but I'm the same OG\nPeople warned me: \"When you on top, there's envy\"\nTook my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us\nSayin' we left the hood, but can't get it out of us\nMy bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?\nHere's my cars and my house, you can live in that too\nCriticize when I flow for the street, hate my dress code\nGucci this, Fendi that \u2013 what you expect, hoe?\nNickname Esco, took this game to its threshold\nBest flow, I bet the whole U.S. know\nTry to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?\nThink we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?\nYou think I'ma come this far\nAnd let you niggas stop me now?\nI hate you too!

I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might've took your first child\nScarred your life or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might've took your first child\nScarred your life or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\nAlways, I'm in some shit!\nMy abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick\nUncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me\nI bust off when they unlock me\nResults of what happens to niggas shock me\nI see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear\nStunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys\nFor years, I've been used in robberies\nGiving niggas heart to follow me\nPlacing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed\nI was laid in a shelf with a grenade\nMet a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:\nFive-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five-and-zero\nHad a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place\nWhere he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him\nTired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun\nBut yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on\nI make myself jam right in my owner's hand\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might've took your first child\nScarred your life or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul\nI might've took your first child\nScarred your life or crippled your style\nI gave you power, I made you buck-wild\nYo, weeks went by and I'm surprised\nStill stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides\nBesides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a 9\nThere's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying\n'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear\nHe's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career\nYo, I can hear somebody coming in\nOpen the shelf, his eyes bubbling\nHe said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him\nShaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching\nHe placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting\nMy creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks\nIt's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories\nBut this time, it's done intentionally\nHe walked me outside, saw this cat\nCocked me back, said, \"Remember me?\"\nHe pulled the trigger, but I held on, it felt wrong\nKnowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him\nHe squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood\nSick of them thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge\nWhat the other kid did was pull out, no doubt\nA newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase\nMy owner fell to the floor, his wig split\nSo fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'!\nHeard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming\nNow I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me\nDamn!47Embed"

We was friends, we had it all\nReason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault\nHe in the grave \u2013 let it go, he no longer living\nSaid you caught him cheating with mom, fucking other women\nFuck that gotta do with us? Here's the keys to the newest truck\nBirkin bags, we burning cash, now baby, do it up\nNo matter who you fuck, that was before me\nWanted you as my shorty since I saw you screaming\n\"Hate you so much right now\"\nShould've saw the meaning, angry black women\nActions of a demon, I'm leaving\n\nI guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye\nI guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby\nYou might also like\nBye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave\nSeven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed\nLet's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years\nYou and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird\nSame time, different year, I was digging y'all flow\nThen I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know\nI thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches\nI was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin\nYet, the cuter version, yet, I knew you personally\nBetter than you knew yourself, and I knew this for certain\nCrib in the Dominican, we got away from everybody\nYou screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably\nThe highlight of my life, like \"Ha, yo, look at my wife!\"\nGangsta, me and 20 cops 'bout to fight, crazy night\nBailed you out, next morning we got clean\nLike it never happened, then later we at that Heat game\nJust another day in the life, of two people in love\nBut it wasn't enough, so baby guess what...\n\nI guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)\nOH! OH! AHHHHHHHH! Bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\nI can't believe that this is happening to us\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby) Forever\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye\nI guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby\nListen, could you imagine writing your deposition?\nDivorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?\nWith you paying out the ass and I'm talking half\nNot some, but half, no, serious, half\nHalf of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind\nIt\u2019s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind\nAnd all I seen was suckers, cowards\nUnder their breath, saying, \"Why did Nas trust her?\"\nBut look at yourself! Speak louder, bruh!\nYou live with your baby moms\nAnd scared to make an honest woman out of her\nAnd make her your bride, fake pimps, you ain't even a lie\nAt least I can say I tried, plus enjoyed the ride\nPlus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride\nHe got my nose, my grill, your color, your eyes\nNext go round I hope I pick the truest type\nAnd watch me do it all again, it\u2019s a beautiful life, aight?\nGoodbye!\n\n(Bye baby) Baby.. baby\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\nI can't believe that this is happening to us\n'Cause I'm saying bye-bye (Bye baby)\nI guess you just knew and blew a good thing\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye\nI guess you just knew and blew a good thing, baby\nGimme the key back, baby\nI want your love back, baby, oh\nGimme the key back, baby, oh\n'Til we make love just one more time\nMake it seem forever\nThis is our last and final goodbye\nGoodbye16Embed"

The cops gon' bust you\"\nI was a teen drunk off brew\nStumbled I wondered if God sent him 'cause two squad cars entered the block\nAnd looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched\nI took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair\nStarin' at a young disciple\nI almost gave my life to what the dice do\nYeah man, throwin' them bones\nHopin' my ace get his case thrown\nHis girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'\nWhile he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin' their little cooch\nGangstas don't die, he's living proof\nThe D.A. who tried him was lyin'\nA white dude, killed his mother during the case\nHung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced\nPre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier\nWalks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild\nTriple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle\nI wanna crack a smile when I see him\nThrow up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom\nHe grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'\nThen he grabbed the judge, screams out, \"Nobody leavin'\nEverybody\u2014\"\nYou might also like\nGet down, get down! Get down, get down!\nGet, get, get, get, get, get, get down!\nEverybody\nGet down, get down!

I turned to punch them\nSouthern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me\nI left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy\nNow I'm back around the old school that raised me\nNew York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see\nA dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay\nThe letter say, \"Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.\"\nI rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral\nNever saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible\nThe nigga still alive in a hospital\nMidnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too\nSee, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs\nHe plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano\nGave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano\nShe passed me the indigo, but the imbecile\nShoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed\nOpenin' the hotel room door to let her goons in\nBut I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit\nI let the hammers blow, wet three kids\nSee honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama\n'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed\nCalled up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you\nHe responded, \"Cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers\u2014\"\nGet down, get down! Get down, get down!\nGet, get, get, get, get, get, get down!\nEverybody\nGet down, get down!

The world is still mine\nTattoo's real, with \"God's Son\" across the belly, the boss of rap\nYou saw me in Belly with thoughts like that\nTo take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie\nMe and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle\nYou lames could huddle, your team's shook\nY'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field\nThrowin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel\nBut the QB don't stand for no quarterback\nEvery word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft\nAnd I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in\nIt's for the hood by the corner store\nMany try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody\nYou might also like\nI got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou want beef?

Not a soul reppin'\nHit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection, yo\nI got mine, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou from the hood, I hope you got yourself a gun\nYou want beef?

My gun off safety\nSince the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD\nYou might also like\nSilent rage, pristine in my vintage shades\nI'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage, I am the dragon\nMaserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend\nBlastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans\nMy little Jackie Onassis, dig?\nI'm so high I never land like Mike Jackson's crib\nVest on, .45 still crack ya rib, sacrilege\nTalk trash 'bout the Nasty kid\nPast nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive\nTalk money, is you jokin'?\nCash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa\nIn the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket\nOn the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it\nYou envy, but don't offend me, I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley\nYou are your car, what could represent me?\nToo godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly\nMust design me somethin' Tommy Montana from Queens had before the 90's\nDrug dealer car, rush to the bar\nMove, niggas! We don't give a fuck who you are\nBlack card heavy like a magnet in my stitched denims\nPretty women see them saggin'\nBet a hundred stacks niggas'll run it back\nJust havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black, light another blunt in fact, haha...\n\n(Nasty) Nasty kid\n(Nasty) Yeah...\n(Nasty) The kid! (Nasty) Yeah...\n(Nasty) Nasty kid (Nasty)\nFor the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it\nGot a bunch of niggas in prison braggin' saying, \"It was Nas I used to hustle with\"\nI display fashions while my lungs engage hashish\nGuns on my waist, past this\nSince I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'\nAnd joinin' the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'\nExcuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted\nOr used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly\nI never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'\nI guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'\nFake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys\nBeen in them wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors\nFor my team, nigga, your flow cheap as limousine liquor\nI'm no fake rap CD listener\nSit back and roll a mean swisher\nFor my G's, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga31Embed"

How could I not partake?\nFifteen, I got a gun\nSixteen, I robbed a train\nLicked off a shot for fun\nWhat's got inside my brain?\nA hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king\nBut I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the midst of\nDudes who switch up and change\nThey wanna carry me like I'm some kind of lame\nI never let them though, I just forgive them though\nEither that or the pistol blow\nYou might also like\n\"Say YEAH!\nHaha, thank ya!\nAhhh, Hallelujah!\nY'all don't hear me now! Somebody help me!\"\n\nI remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah\nWalking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah\nWorth two hundred million now\nBicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums\nBrazilian women on Xannies, they pulling off panties\nI'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one\nDon't applaud me, I'm exhausted, G\nMe and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup\nY'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut\nRemember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck\nSaid stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani\nHood forever, I just act like I'm civilized\nReally what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers\nTo take over J.P. and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs\nAnd teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back\n\n\"Say YEAH!\nHaha, thank ya!\nAhhh, Hallelujah!\nY'all don't hear me now!

Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers\nWhy it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it\nIt's just an intro, hate it or love it, like it, bump it or dump it\nWrite it, across the stomach, spell \"God's Son\"\nLife is like a jungle, black, it's like the habitat of Tarzan\nMatter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine\nMost of my niggas packed in correctional facilities\nHalf of them passed on, MAC strong, couple of shots\nMade the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block\nWhere they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place\nA younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that\nSame walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible?\nA thug dies, another step inside his shoes\nAnd they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle\nI'm blowin' circles, my state of mind purple\n\nLight it, light it, uhh\nYeah... light it up\nLight it up, uh\nYou might also like\nY'all just wanna deal with drama\nTalk about niggas who got things, y'all ready to kill his mama\nEverything you into is underworld related\nYou sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred\nYou don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers\nTo pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder\nThink of how many dudes died tryna be down with you\nEverybody's under six feet of ground, but you\nStill standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real\nYou a survivor, knowin' all the beef is ill\nYou got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready\nTrustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly\nThe hood love you, but behind your back, they pray for the day\nA bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away\nThat ain't love, it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes\nWhose sons you killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?\nUnmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God\nSomebody tell these shorties reach for the stars\nInstead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars holdin' a mirror\nLookin' down a tier in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya\nWeed smoke, three tokes, nigga, pour more Henny\nHe sighs with eyes that seen a war too many\nCold-blooded murderers, universal\nHood to hood, blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple\nLight it up, light it up, light it up, uhh\nLight it up\u2026 light it up, light it up, uhh\nUhh\u2026 uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh\n\nThese hot-headed youngsters always get into trouble\nReactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated\nAnd murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin'\nWhen we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail\nDrug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'\nInstead of movin' forward to blow up, so what's the science?\nPeople shoutin', police pushin' the crowd\nAnd on the ground's a young soldier with meat hangin' out him\nAm I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?\nOr did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in?\nIt's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots\nPhotograph pictures of suspect faces\nIt's usually two or three niggas who innocent\nBut if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch\nA divide-and-fall strategy, they aren't fair\nI dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair\nThis Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy\nAnd Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me\nThis is how I escape the madness\nToo much of anything'll hurt you, so my state of mind's all purple29Embed"

His waistband big\nBut he don't have that thing in him, slangin' just ain't in him\nBody language is off, he's soft\nBut soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'\n'Cause he feel a way: my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway\nOne look could tell me if you really came to kill me\nBe the quiet nigga lookin' lame with the milli\nWho that over there creepin'? Who homie by the tree?\nBetter safe than sorry, look at p-noid me\nFew machine guns close, we could squeeze all three\nBe a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me\nIt's a lesson every premonition\nLot of niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention, listen\nYou might also like\nI want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust\nAccountants lookin' over my figures I can trust\nA lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust\nDamn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough\nOr Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust\nGoons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust\nAnd if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?\nSome of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more\n\nIt's been so long, can't remember how we begun this war\nThis is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off\nI see your moms, she still speak\nShe don't know I ain't cool with her son no more\nIt's old shit, see, forever we holdin' this grudge\nTakes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs\nWe buried our dead, been years, why should I worry 'bout him?\nConstantly watchin' my back, plus niggas tellin' I dread\nAnother day I put a family in black\nThough I be calm and relaxed\nThough I know somehow it will come back\nEven if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life\nWhat was it worth to see you covered in dirt?\nIt's quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted\nMothers cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide\nJust tattoos of my niggas' names\nI wonder, will it change? Let's ride\u2026\nI want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust\nAccountants lookin' over my figures I can trust\nA lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust\nDamn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough\nOr Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust\nGoons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust\nAnd if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?\nSome of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more\n\nIt's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position\nA caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions\nFrom the mind of a man who went at it with killers\nSit down, little man, let me school you in hood business\nSeen a lot of niggas blow, lot of dreams folded\nSome wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated\nAin't too much left to buy, bought it, I'm loaded, I guess\nLear jets, I ask myself: do I need love or success?\nThey say the artist that truly suffers, his stuff is the best\n'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve: pain, pistols and sex\nRemember spray paintin' the word \"fresh\" and then starin' at it\nOlder folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it\nBuildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the McLaren past it\nSame old man from years ago told me life is short\nSo from infant to geriatric, trust your own judgment\nLive with it and love it\nI want a bitch I can trust, some niggas I can trust\nAccountants lookin' over my figures I can trust\nA lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust\nDamn my nigga, trust, I can never get enough\nOr Rugers I can trust, shooters I can trust\nGoons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust\nAnd if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?\nSome of you niggas' true colors becomin' clear more10Embed"

(uhh)\nGuess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time\nWeak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs\nI'm standing on the roof of my building\nI'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it\nJust like an acrobat ready to hurl myself, through the hoops of fire\nSippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire\nCould it be the forces of darkness\nAgainst hood angels of good that form street politics?\nMakes a sweet honest kid turn illegal for commerce (uhh)\nTo get his feet out of them Converse, that's my word\nI feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in\nCan't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them (uhh, uhh)\nCan't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him (nah)\nProbably end up back in the hood, ah, \"Fuck it then\"\nI feel like a black militant takin' over the government\nCan't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them\nCan't clean my act up for good, too much thug in him\nProbably end up back in the hood, I'm like, \"Fuck it then\"19Embed"

What it feel like to go miss it?\nYou might also like\nIn one city, one country, one state\nSome place to be nobody\nSome place to be- Some place you wouldn't know probably\nSome place to be nobody\n\nMy dawg bought a plane, said \"Let's go to Paris\"\nThat's where baguettes are from, French bread that's long and narrow\nI like the other definition, rectangular carats\nThe concept of this song is rather esoteric\nThis girl said in Grenada we should go get married\nBroke the meanin' down of the Virgin Mary\nAnd you got your own place, my favorite part of the night\nWhen you text me that you made it home safe (I'm home)\nI'm contemplatin' at the home base\nHow I'm used to breakfast in the ghetto, sippin' OJ\nThat's a picture right there, a moment in time\nBefore anybody wanted a photo of mine\nBefore the internet energy and social decline\nDestroyed the vibe, foolin' us with the headlines\n(Keepin' us blind) Vultures eat you alive\n(Take heed to the signs) Wishin' I'd find\n\nOne city, one country, one state\nSome place to be nobody\nSome place to be- Some place you wouldn't know probably\nSome place to be nobody (Life)\nAll my time has been focused on my freedom now\nWhy would I join 'em when I know that I can beat 'em now?\nThey put their words on me, and they can eat 'em now\nThat's probably why they keep on tellin' me I'm needed now\nThey tried to box me out while takin' what they want from me\nI spent too many years livin' too uncomfortably\nMaking room for people who didn't like the labor\nBut wanted the spoils, greedy, selfish behavior\nNow let me give it to you balanced and with clarity\nI don't need to turn myself into a parody\nI don't, I don't do the shit you do for popularity\nThey clearly didn't understand when I said \"I Get Out\" apparently\nMy awareness like Keanu in The Matrix\nI'm savin' souls and y'all complainin' 'bout my lateness\nNow it's illegal for someone to walk in greatness\nThey want the same shh, but they don't take risks\nNow the world will get to see its own reflection\nAnd the anointed can pursue their own direction\nAnd if you're wrong and you're too proud to hear correction\nWalk into the hole you dug yourself, fuck a projection\nSee me in my freedom takin' all my land back\nThey said a lot against me thinkin' I'd just stand back\nI got my legs beneath me, I got my hands back\nA lot of people sabotaged, they couldn't stand that\nI turned the other cheek, I took blow after blow\nThere's so much crisis in the world 'cause you reap what you sow\nWhen you keep what you know is meant for someone else\nThe ditch you dig for them, you might just end up in yourself\nI'm in the secret place, I keep a sacred space\nThey keep showin' their hands, but keep hidin' their face\nIf I'm a messenger, you block me then you block the message\nSo aggressive, the world you made is what you're left with\nPride and ego over love and truth is fuckin' reckless\nY'all niggas got a death wish, the stupid leaves me breathless\nSome place to be, yeah\nAin't duckin' nothin'\nJust might have to build my own city\nWhere y'all need a real nigga passport to enter\nMs. Hill, we ain't goin' nowhere\nThey gon' have to deal with us\nMake 'em uncomfortable, hahaha, yeah15Embed"

Why argue niggas?\nThe truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas\nThey wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this\nPointing to they scars like, right here, baby, really Nas did this\nLike a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest\nWar stories we tell them, nothing's realer than karma\nSip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey\nRap Jack Dempsey, matte black Bentley, pimply\nShattering your silence, passing round the chalice\nDue to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery\nOfficial kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with\nFuck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst\nI'll fuck your wife 'cause she a groupie, scandalous\nThis for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous\nYou might also like\nYo, what we talking 'bout niggas?\nWhat we talking 'bout niggas?\nThis is Nas, what, Nas\nWhat, Nasty, what, recollect motherfucker\n\nUhh, uhh, uhh\nAt seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing\nIntegrity intact, repping hard\nThey asking how he disappear and reappear back on top\nSaying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something\nTo keep winning is my way like Francis\nAs long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances\nA soldier coming home, twenty years old with no legs\nSayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head\nSo much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start\nSo I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart\nI know you think my life is good 'cause my diamond piece\nBut my life been good since I started finding peace\nI shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed\nI been rich longer than I been broke, I confess\nI started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back\nLike Trump being up down up, play with cash, huh\n\nMy nigga's like a locomotive\nNas, we pushed it, mush it\nQueensbridge to Bushwick\nHarlem, Bronx, all that\nYou ain't even supposed to be here\nYou know where you at?\nAt night, New York, eat a slice too hot\nUse my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth\nShit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot\nStaggering, drunker than them cops that 2Pac shot\nI was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed reaching\nSoon as I heard them iron wheels screeching\nWhen it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught\nToken man safe behind a locked door for sure\nMinor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting\nLooking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing\nIn my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick\nBugging on how his imagination was so sick\nIt's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth\nAlcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies\nHow dare I, must be, something in the air that corrupts me\nLook at my upkeep, owned and sublease\nI'm here y'all\n\nThis for my trapped in the 90s niggas\nFor my trapped in the 90s niggas\nHa for y'all niggas12Embed"

It might've saved me later from my block\nN.Y. cops, hookers crawlin' off the stroll, coughin'\nStitches in they head, stinkin' and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin'\nBut who else could it be?\nShook at these unmarked vans, parked in the dark\nNARC's \u2014 where's your heart?\nHustlers starve, they bust a U-ey, I jog\nTo my building, come out later wearin' camouflage\nSee the sergeant and the captain strangle men\nNiggas gaspin' for air 'til they move no more and just stare\nWith dead eyes, tired of riots, shit is quiet\nSimple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews\nOvercrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant\nFathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested\nHad eight partners growin' up, eight turned to seven\nSeven turned to six niggas, got two in heaven\nSix of us holdin' it, now it's five rollin' thick\nThe 6th one's parole flipped, five niggas went to four quick\nWhen he went O.T., college life\nConverted into gangbangin', four niggas still hangin'\nYears passin' and slang changin'\nThree of us now, 4th nigga ain't around\nWe all thought he was real, he did the snake shit, fake shit\nBeat his ass down\nYo, his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown\nAll I got left in the end is two of my best friends\nAnd we all goin' out to the death for these ends!\nWhat?!\nYou might also like\nNew York, New York (New York State of Mind)\nNew York, New York (New York State of Mind)\n\nYou heard about it, you see about it\nYou read about it, it's in your papers\nIt's in your daily news (\"Get money!\")\nNew York chronicles, every day\nThe crime rate, the murder rate\nThe money rate, the paper chase (Aight?)\nYou know what I mean?\nNew York state of mind, baby (Oh, yeah!)\nCheck it out (Yeah)\n\nI'm at the gamblin' spot, my hands on a knot\nNew York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot\nI take a nigga dough, send him home to his shoe box\n\"You lost that, nigga, I'd put your dollar in the jukebox\"\nHear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along\nAll the cigarette smoke's cloggin' my lungs\nHoodrats flashin' they tongue\nYoung thugs blastin' they gun \u2014 we got reputations\nBitches and niggas both on parole or probation\nShit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues\nI got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave\n'Cause I ain't playin'\nNiggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit\nStick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks\nBunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas\nLift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you\nSome of these dudes the Feds be on 'em, you knew 'em for years\nBe the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers\nThat ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears\nYour name's on the affidavit \u2014 you ratted, kid\nFaggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids\nFuck you!

How did they know?\nSixteen years later, here I go\nYou might also like\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\nI'm with Akinyele in the street, tryin' to get us a deal\nG Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill\nBut Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted\nClark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us\nRussell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted\nReef and Matty C offered me a little money\nShit a little funny, feel a little laughter\nRebel of Hip-Hop comin' through a white rapper\nMy boy MC Serch, nevertheless\nTook me to Columbia, back then CBS\nChris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man\nNow buggin' because the label had just dropped Def Jam\nCould you picture Russell needin' a check, man?\nBut he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram\nLife is ill, again life's a movie\nThen the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas and Fugees\nBefore I sold records, no promotion\nThe rap world like, \"What's all this commotion?\"\nWent plat, mad bottles I'm toastin'\n20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then?\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\nInvincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh\nUh, but back to the matter at hand\n\u2018Cause 10 years ago we all strived to be 25\nSome cats didn't make it alive\nDated some stars but respect their privacy\nCopped mad cars, layin' back in the driver's seat\nHeld myself down, just steerin' the wheel\nHere I am, completed my whole record deal\n\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\"What-what, what-what, what would I do?\"\n\nWhat would I do\nIf I could reach inside of me\nAnd to know how it feels\nTo say I like what I see?15Embed"

Can I walk? Can I speak? Can I talk?\nCan I floss without you wanting me outlined in chalk?\nFamily gossiping, pocket watching him\nJealousy keeps blossoming, ain't let it box me in (King)\n'Cause you are not a king if you can't come out a thing\nThat you got yourself in, claiming nobody helping\nThe stupidest part of Africa produced Blacks that started algebra\nProof, facts, imagine if you knew that as a child, bruh\nNostalgia, how I rememb\u0435r things\nRemember crowns, remember, kings\nThey want your reign to cease (King)\nYou a king, you will be next to me, doing your own king shit, most definitely\nWe're so \"Say less when I speak\", y'all estrogen speak\nRespected by kings only, address me as chief\nInvested in things only a vet would\nOnly lames front on kings, that's expected from creeps\nYou mad at my niggas and any woman with interest in me\nYou could've made it (You was good), look at all the time wasted\nNow you gotta retract statements, shoulda stuck to the basics\nAll you had to do was tell the truth, like, fuck all the fake shit\nYou should want every brother to make it out\nBut brothers want trophies, they troll for clout\nRap is weird, weird flex, but okay\nYou ain't as ill as you think, you just okay\nYou got pressed in the hood, fix your jibs up, I'm on top\nStop fighting it, yo, stop with the over-righteousness\nIt's so lame, this media circus greedy and worthless\nMy life got 'em tight, why they wanna see me hurt up?

Lyrics\nI want you to close your eyes\nAnd vision the most beautiful place in the world\nIf you in the hood on the ghetto street corner\nCome on this journey, the best journey\nA mansion, acres of land and swimming pools and all that\nCheck it out\n\nI'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings\nTo fly like doves over the streets, watchin' many things\nKids walkin' home from school on drug blocks\nMissionaries pass out papers that read, \"Love God\"\nI see faces, cases, judges, and juries, Masons, lawyers and cops\nI watch because every thug's face is my mirror\nBut this was one in particular\nThis kid, he was the vintage stick 'em up pro\nSixteen years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go\nEvery morning, calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke\nHe insane, already gone mad blames himself for his setbacks\nDangerous street corners where it sets at\nSlang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs\nChasin' him, his asthma's flarin'\nSmokin' like a chimney, on Remy, of course he not carin'\nHe need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'\nI give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion\nYou might also like\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, 'cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love, and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\n\nDear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good\nTell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods\nSeen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook\nDrippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke\nThen some lady named Billie Holiday sang\nSittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came\nLittle LaTasha sho' grown\nTell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home\nMaybe in time you'll understand only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' loose with the band\nJust think of all the people that you knew in the past\nThat passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last\nPicture a place that they exist, together\nThere has to be a place better than this, in Heaven\nSo right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'\nRemember this face, save me a place in Thugz Mansion\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, 'cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love, and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion\n\nA place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide\nNot to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by\nNo policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets\nNo reason for nobody's momma to cry\nSee, I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter\nBut if I should die, I know all of my albums support her\nThis whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me\nOnly difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe\n'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'\nI'm just twenty-some-odd years\nI done lost my mother and I cried tears of joy\nI know she smiles on her boy\nI dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur\n'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war\nAnd just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more\n'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne\nWhere angels soar with golden wings in Thugz Mansion\nEvery corner, every city\nThere's a place where life's a little easy\nLittle Hennessy, laid back and cool\nEvery hour, 'cause it's all good\nLeave all the stress from the world outside\nEvery wrong done will be alright\nNothing but peace, love, and street passion\nEvery ghetto needs a thug mansion18Embed"

What's in a name? Suffering and pain\nGuts, blood, and tears, aim straight, game face, king's grace\nI came in this thinkin' you was gon' be this great thing\n'Cause I seen the greats do it with a great queen\nWhat these kings have in common? They had women who solid\nMalcolm needed Betty, I met some queens who wasn't ready\nThey envy the unhappiness of the greats\nThey don't have a fulfilled life yet, so they searchin' for ways\nTo feel what Sam felt, play the hand Marvin was dealt\nA Vandross, here's the cure, the antidote\nA thousand milligrams, make sure you don't overdose\nTurned to a businessman, used to serve 'em in the cold\nCold game, don't get exposed, stories get told\nYou glamorize the game, it ain't a glorious road\nRest in peace Kobe and Nip, that's off the rip\nKing shit, if it ain't about fam, it don't mean shit\nThe cure, love of the allure\nDonuts rotten, the phone tapped, tappin' in with Lord\nYou might also like\nRoll the credits\n\nCuban link QB chain belong in the MOMA\nSo boomerang, you salute my twenty-seven summers\nRolls-Royce Brigade just 'cause it go with the moment\nPac saw the chain, got his medallion, I won't\nInsinuate imitation 'cause I copied his stomach\nKings honor kings, straight from my pop to my son shit\nSteak tartare bloody, mercury levels from raw fish\nSushi for lunch, waiter at the table, the cork twist\nI'm studied like a book by many\nThey give me looks of envy, I took the Bentley\nWhite chick like Liz Taylor might get the Bentayga\nOn my Rick James behavior\nLife is school for the soul and I'm in life seven already\nLife's simple but heavy, incomprehensible shit\nEverything from sexy to deadly, I done been through that shit\nStill goin' deeper like I grew a new inch on my dick\nWe looked at robbin' as a way of resolving our problems\nMy moms cooked food, but some of my niggas was starving\nAnd whatever they was down to do, I was with 'em regardless\nTurns out I was hungry and was hittin' the hardest\nDecisions was sharper, my predictions was on it\nNo fortune teller, just going off regular signs\nNiggas often tell ya they moves\nWithout a word, just reading they mind\nWasn't needin' no nine\nCorner executive born in ghetto hell\nWhere metal yell especially over necklaces\nLife lessons is karma\nWhatever you dish out come back as blessings or to haunt ya\nCould miss your kids and hit your grandkids for your dishonor\nThat's generational curses, they said they want the old Nas back\nPlay the Clue tapes for old verses\nMessin' my homies' lives up, sayin' Nas'll rise 'em up\nLike they wasn't live enough, many lives I've touched\nCan I get a witness?\nCan I get a witness?\nI need a witness, drinkin' three at night on some Bridge shit\nWearin' shorts and Timbs, summer night on some Bridge shit\nParty with gangsters, gettin' right on some Bridge shit (Yeah)\nLike MC Shan and Marley, I be on some Bridge shit\nYeah\nLike Jabari, I'm on some Bridge shit\nShooter live on\nKings live forever\nYeah\nWe go through a lot\nAnd nobody wanna hear about what we go through\nAnd that's cool too\nEvery man go through the same Mondays and Fridays\nSame sun, moon, and stars\nIt's just how you stand like a man10Embed"

You know shit is rough after you slid\nYou in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid\nAin't nuttin' changed, still Party and Bullshit\nWe used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest\nFor every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out\nMachine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts\nYou came to my hood, we was broke\nI wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gun smoke?\nStill on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so\n'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto\nBut fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones\nPeace to your daughter and your newborn son\nIt used to be fun, makin' records to see your response\nBut, now competition is none, now that you're gone\nAnd these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain\nAnd they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that\nIt's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you\nJoke with you, happy we on top, the most official\nAin't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're\nCapable to take it where you took it to\nI missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake\n'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way\nI woulda stayed so long with so much to say\nI had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'\nTellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side\nBut I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by\nYou can't kill nothin' that's Ready To Die\nYou was like God to us in the form of Allah\nYou might also like\nStill somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?\n\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\n\n(Thug Life never die..)\nDear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop\nAnd use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out A Lil' Liquor\nYou was more than just the wildest nigga\n2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga\nIt's goin on the third year, since you've been gone\nOn the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on\nThe industry be talkin', offendin' me often\nThey don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin\nI can relate, shootouts and court dates\nAll eyez on you, niggas in your face invadin' your space\nYou asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?\nHow long would I ride before I fold up?\nHow did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?\nYou predicted it in every line, all in your flow\nThere could never be peace I have to quote\nCan't believe I heard my name on \"the realest shit you ever wrote\"\nWe had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top\nBut kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped\nIn NYC, at MTV, people watched\nWe was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep\nThink about how us real niggas would be\nIf we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?\nYou was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified\nLike the son of God, when Lucifer lied\nAnd make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?\nBut Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link\nWill there ever be another MC as nice?\nWill you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?\nStill somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?\n\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\n\nI wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?\nDid Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?\nWhat has Al Green seen, that made him religious?\nWas it the drugs, put an end to the music business?\nIf so, should I put out the indo right now and write down\nA plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around\n'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream\nI'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens\nIt be the ones you always knew, that want it on\nTellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on\nThought we walked a million miles it was just twenty\nNot used to walkin' in the path of legit money\nI thought I made it but we only took baby steps\nUp the success ladder, where they pay me checks\nTo my clicks when I got it I said \"Baby bless\"\nThat was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess\nWe in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good\nHip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would\nA lot of ups and downs in the game\nCould lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain\nOne day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out\nSome is 'bout it, most individuals plots\nAnd run the spots, some choose to stay to they selves\nWhile others have no cares and stay in jail\nMore than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest\nThrough the head, through the gut it shows\nThe future for us young shooters and old killers\nWho become rich as dope dealers?\nNothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments\nThug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap\nWe want the fast way out of this trap\nWhether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack\nTo my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back\nBut life is a dream and y'all taught me that\n.. always survive.. but why?\n\nAlways survive, always\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive (no matter what)\nStill, we, will survive (no matter what)\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my niggas just stay alive8Embed"

Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nAnd will the money and fame outlast me?\nThe blunts ash falls down in the ashtray\nWell, I see my whole life fly past me\nI'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nDid I?

Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nAnd will the money and fame outlast me?\nThe blunts ash falls down in the ashtray\nWell, I see my whole life fly past me\nI'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nDid I?

Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals\nShe's what a temptress be\nThe death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery!\nOr the Chicagoan Harold Washington\nSomeone is sabotaging 'em\nWatch out for the traps\nLarry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman\nThen he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp\nAnd I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats\nThis is what came from their pain\nFrom their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange\nAs the blunt ash falls into the ash tray\nI could see my whole life fly past me\nDid I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nAnd will the money and fame outlast me?\nThe blunts ash falls down in the ashtray\nWell, I see my whole life fly past me\nI'm asking, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nDid I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me\n\nI could smell old Bogey cigars\nLauren Bacall perfumes, smelling just as sweet\nMe and my wife K, flying in a drop-top\nLike Ruby and Ossie Davis, baby \u2013 know what I mean?\nYo, man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout\nHattie McDaniel got a Oscar\nFor playing Mammy in \"Gone with the Wind\"\nAnd she didn't get allowed\nWasn't even allowed to go to the premier\nBelieve that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint\nMan, you know they were strong back then, man\nBlunt from my ashtray, nothing gon' to live past me, yeah3Embed"

Material, women, and large paper\nThat means you inferior, not major\nNo idea's original, there's nothing new under the sun\nIt's never what you do, but how it's done\nWhat you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper\nThat means you inferior, not major\n\nIf niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find\nWhere bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes\nGo to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard\nWhere weed's responsible for memory loss\nLet's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous\nSee what I seen every day I live with this torture\nLightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours\nSleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower\nMy tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons\nLong as I'm still breathin', I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em\nThe hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl\nEverybody had money, every summer was real ill\nFour-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane\nNo Half Steppin' with flat tops when Rakim reigned\nRadios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin'\nAsk for today's mathematics, we Allah's children\nAnd this was goin' on in every New York ghetto\nKids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork in Jell-o\nWe coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference\nOn a different coast, but we share the same sunlight\nYour part of the world might be like colors and gangs\nWhile on my side, brothers'll murder for different things\nBut it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties\nStuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story\nFrom, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis\nThem treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias\nBe scrappin' with tats on they back, violent wars\nNothin' less than a lethal injection if ever caught\nCourtrooms, eagles and flags, American style\nWhile in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul\nWatchin' for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child\nBut them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out\nThe chain be like a hundred K\nShinin' since Roxanne Shante' made Runaway; that's been a minute\nGenesis is deep, my features are that of a God\nIt's not a facade, it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas\nMy Exodus doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind\nEven with sleep I'm duckin' nines in my dreams\nSi-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change\nCan't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things\nLike, somebody's always watchin'\nMy life before I, walk out the door I size up every option\nEyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns\nWhich is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one\nI mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled\nHeadline readin' \"Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin'\"You might also like8Embed"
