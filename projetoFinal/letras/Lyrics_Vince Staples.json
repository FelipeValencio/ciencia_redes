  "plain": "Vincent Jamal Staples, simply known as Vince Staples, is an American rapper hailing from Long Beach, CA.\n\nVince has been making waves since his initial breakout with the Odd Future crew and has signed a deal with Def-Jam and the legendary No I.D.\u2019s label Artium. Everything you need to know about how dope Mr. Staples can be found in his ridiculous, breakout verse on \u201cHive\u201d by Earl Sweatshirt. While you\u2019re at it, Vince has released a slew of projects over the course of the past few years, including the Shyne Coldchain series, (both 1 and 2), and the Hell Can Wait EP. It all culminates to his debut album, Summertime 06.\n\nAfter the release of Summertime \u201806, Vince would go on to release his Prima Donna EP which would feature one of hip-hop\u2019s biggest artists, A$AP Rocky.\n\nVince would then go on to release Big Fish Theory on June 23rd, 2017. The album featured even bigger names than the Prima Donna EP. Kendrick Lamar, Juicy J, Ty Dolla $ign, and even another project with A$AP Rocky on it.\n\nVince has a rather small award count, with only winning one and being nominated for another. In 2014 BET would give him the award \u2018Best Impact Track\u2019 for his song \u201cKingdom\u201d. The Black Reel Awards would later nominate him for \u2018Best Original or Adapted Song\u2019 with his song \u201cWaiting for My Moment\u201d which was adapted from the movie Creed.\n\nDespite him believing he should have won or been nominated for a Grammy for his album, Big Fish Theory, it was not nominated. Vince doesn\u2019t think it should have been nominated for \u2018Best Rap Album of the Year\u2019 but rather \u2018Best Electronic Album of the Year\u2019.\n\nVince started off March of 2018 with a huge bang. He released a song called \u201cGet The Fuck Off My Dick\u201d which had a $2 million GoFundMe page attached to it with a line saying \u201cGet off my dick or fund my lifestyle\u201d."

better listen when I speak my mind!\"\nUsed to think he was unbreakable he did fed time\nBut made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined\nWas walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that\nFootball was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High\nBut my daddy was the man that would be suicide\nPicked me up from visitation in the newest ride\nAlways told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride\nAs a kid all I wanted was to kill a man\n\nCause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot\nWith the caddy tinted, fuck handouts\nFuck the county building, never seen that\nCatch him riding round the city with the seat back\nWith the seat back, with the seat back\nCatch him ride round the city with the seat back\nWith the seat back, with the seat back\nCatch him ride round the city with the seat back\nYou might also like\nAs a kid all I wanted was a hundred grand\nUncle counting money while my daddy cut him grams\nMade me promise that this shit would never touch my hands\nAnd it never did said it'd make me be a better man\nSmoking in the crib, hiding dip inside of soda cans\nBlack bandana on his arm, needle in his hand\nMomma trying to wake him up, young so I ain't understand\nWhy she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, used to see him stand\nOut in the alley through my window\nDrinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke\nLights flashing now he running from the Winslows\nHear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor\nSometimes she wouldn't open it, sitting on the couch\nFace emotionless, I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it\nAs a kid all I wanted a hundred grand\n\nCause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot\nWith the caddy tinted, fuck handouts\nFuck the county building, never seen that\nCatch him riding round the city with the seat back\nWith the seat back, with the seat back\nCatch him ride round the city with the seat back\nWith the seat back, with the seat back\nCatch him ride round the city with the seat back\nNo, No, No, No\nNiggas die everyday don't know how to live, don't know how to make sense\n25 to life today just got locked away, all that just to pay rent\nNow they're all bound on the slave ship\nAnd they left behind their patience\nThought that'd last them for a little\nPass it down for my kin, ohh\n\nCause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot\nWith the caddy tinted, fuck handouts\nFuck the county building, never seen that\nCatch him riding round the city with the seat back\nWith the seat back, with the seat back\nCatch him ride round the city with the seat back\nWith the seat back, with

Did we make mistakes?\nCan't drop on your bail, can't check on your case\nKnow that you won't tell, that's why I'm afraid\nYou'll probably never get to see the light of day\nI'm ashamed to say I think I hate you now\nWe should've took 'em on a chase 'cause I can't save you now\nAt least give me a chance to try to lay 'em down\nIs you trippin'? You forgettin' that we made these vows?\nStill here I am, waiting 'round\nDreaming that you comin' home, right your wrongs, take me out\nI can't wait until you bust it down\nProbably go a hunnid rounds\nI keep calling\nI keep calling (Oh, ooh)\nI keep calling\nI keep calling\nI keep calling (Oh, ooh)\nI keep calling\nI keep calling\nI keep calling (Oh, ooh)\nI keep calling\nI like him 'cause, you know, 'cause...\n'Cause I know  when somebody go back for me\nWe'll be back together and we can have a little fun\nBut he's in jail right now\nFor something that he had no business in doin'\n\"What did he do?\"\nThey said he killed somebody11Embed\nIt's been two years, I keep calling\nI'm standing here and I ain't got you\nAs we lay here, lovers in arms\nI can feel your fear, can this love be true?\nCome on, lift me up, love, I keep falling\nI'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling\nLift me up, love, I keep falling\nI'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling\n\nShe said, \"Baby, keep me closely\", love it when you hold me\"\nKnow that I'm a real one, I don't do no ghostin'\nI know that you love me, you don't gotta show me\nOff to the world, please, hide me from the police\nEverywhere you go, we together, inseparable\nYou know I'm down for whatever, protective of you\nI don't wanna use protection with you\nBut the glove'll keep you safe if you ever get loose\nNever put you in a jam, hold whatever for you\nWhen you first shot your shot, I knew you would be the one to hit the spot\nOnly you can make it clap for the homies, I am not\nOn the late nights, me and you, circling the block\nTryna make it pop\nPut that pussy nigga 'cross the street from Cherry Park\nHope we don't get caught\nDon't you break my heart\nLove how you illuminate my thoughts\n\nIt's been two years, I keep calling\nI'm standing here and I ain't got you\nAs we lay here, lovers in arms\nI can feel your fear, can this love be true?\nCome on, lift me up, love, I keep falling\nI'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling\nLift me up, love, I keep falling\nI'm losing faith 'cause you keep stalling\n\nDamn, can't believe they took you from me\nKickin' in your front door, lookin' for me\nHid me in our secret place\nNothing I could do for you but sit and wait, contemplate\nDid we leave a trail?

Get twerking\nAnd a nigga gotta sit and wait for it, is it worth it?\nWhy I ask when I already know?\nDon't mind me, mind already gone\nNigga better not keep calling your phone\nHave my dogs in the yard at his home\nYou might also like\nBaby\nBaby\nBaby\nBaby\nYou know you drive me crazy\nYou know you drive me crazy\nYou know you drive me crazy\nYou know you drive me crazy\n\nGirl, you looking like something out of King\u2014\nMagazine, fifteen in the magazine\nHope a nigga don't run up tweaking\nI'm tryna have a good time this evening\n91 Freeway, eastbound, speeding\nLate night, but the face right, I need it\nMando, I'm the man, though, you see it\nNiggas wanna kill me, so I gotta keep it\nI ain't really into clubs or the nightlife\nOnly kick it with the thugs, I ain't never did a drug\nWhen you doing what I does, need your mind right\nThey won't ever catch a nigga at the stoplight\nWhat your life like?

They ain't live it\nLooking straight into their eyes still, and they ain't get it\n\nBut if I had a hundred dollars for every dream that I ever had\nI'd barely have enough to right the wrongs I did in the past\nThey say forgive and forget, look at it and laugh\nWe gave all that we had and got nothing\n\nAs far as music, kid, I'm innovative\nNiggas pretend to hate it, influence you niggas' favorite\nYou stupid believing different, authentic, you lack the stitching;\nSitting when it's game time, snitching when you face time\nWhat's wrong with you niggas?\nSee, I was brought up where that talking get you shot up at apartments\nWhere the bitch that set you up had told you meet her just that morning\nJust a warning, my performance astounding\nEverybody want something, get these niggas from round me\nTryna climb skyscrapers\nLife is but a dream but it's never what it seems\nSo I never leave my weapon at the house\nRather spend time sitting behind bars than in the grave\nI'm getting paid tryna change from my sinning ways\nYou might also like\nBut if I had a hundred dollars for every dream that I ever had\nI'd barely have enough to right the wrongs I did in the past\nThey say forgive and forget, look at it and laugh\nWe gave all that we had and got nothing\n\nWorking on my 1,000 time telling you sorry\nWalking around, pretending it ain't affect me\nBut nothing was further from the truth\nLeast I'm tryna recoup, just blame it on the youth\nNo matter what you feel or seen, I was in it too\nProbably more than you would ever believe\nYou gave me something I would never receive again\nWe prob'ly won't be again, but would you expect it, though?\nI'm just the nigga that I promised you I was\nWhen you swore that I was better\nWas in it through the weather storm\nJust was better moving on\nThere was a time I thought that I would never think about you again\nYou was the best friend a nigga could have\nI used to call you when I thought that I would die that day\nAnd you would calm me down, and I would make my way\nYou prob'ly should have stayed; it just wasn't your place\nI thought about you today23Embed\nI just wanna get my bread\nAnd talk my shit 'fore I end up dead\nI got all this blood sitting on my hands\nI never gave no fuck, so they understand\nWhy I feel this way, just found God and I still don't pray\n'Cause Satan prey on the weak, swear I can do it myself\nSoul stuck in the beats, it's like I'm crying for help;\nStill, my expression is bleak, because my momma ain't\nRaised no bitch, never take no shit\nFrom no nigga 'less he wanna see the black four-fifth\nFrom the ghetto where the oceans is, but all hope is lost\nWe know the laws and quick to break 'em once the dough involved\nYoung age, they wrote us off, guns blaze, they go to court\nI got a lot of homies gone, product of they broken home\nBut who to say what's right and wrong?

girl, lies for the hoes)\nSlide for the Cro\u2019s\n(Ride for the Cro's, nine to your dome)\n\nWarhol on the wall, ball 'til you fall\nNever text, never call, I suggest you applaud\nI\u2019m the set's synagogue, get blessed by the god\nDon't get clapped on\nJust a young black man with a backbone\nIn a black Comme Homme, Comme Black on\nIn the Batmobile, black, no chrome, yeah\nWhen Jabari died, was off the porch for homicides\nThen when Half had died, I bought some things to pass the guys\nBut when Johnny died, all I had was shows booked\nDown to burn in Hell, I don't care how my soul look\nI know you gon' tell, I can tell by your froze look\nBut I love you still, flaws and all, you my dawg\nPut me behind bars and all 'cause we came up at the Park\nIt's just crazy seein' everybody change when things get hard\nYou might also like\nWe just lost somebody else this weekend, no, no\nThink that I am jumping off the deep end, yeah, yeah\nNothing out of something, now it\u2019s leaving\nTryna find my peace of mind, it\u2019s fleeting\nI'm tweakin\u2019, I'm tweakin'\nI'm tweakin\u2019, I'm tweakin'\nI'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'\nI'm tweakin', I'm tweakin'\n\nLook at how far we done came (Yeah, yeah)\nNow I'm a face and a name (Yeah, yeah)\nJust got a call 'bout my tweets (Tweets, yeah)\nTold me to watch what I'm sayin' (Sayin', yeah)\nJust got a call 'bout the streets (Streets, yeah)\nTold me to watch for a Jeep (Jeep, yeah)\nLiberty lurking the east (East, yeah)\nThey hoppin' out, ready to squeeze (Squeeze, yeah)\nNiggas emotional nowadays\nLyin', they hidin' they coward

homicides\nThen when Half had died, I bought some things to pass the guys\nBut when Johnny died, all I had was shows booked\nDown to burn in Hell, I don't care how my soul look\nI know you gon' tell, I can tell by your froze look\nBut I love you still, flaws and all, you my dawg\nPut me behind bars and all 'cause we came up at the Park\nIt's just crazy seein' everybody change when things get hard\n\nWe just lost somebody else this weekend, no, no\nThink that I am jumping off the deep end, yeah, yeah\nNothing out of something, now it\u2019s leaving\nTryna find my peace of mind, it\u2019s

weren't fucking with ya boy, but they heard me now\nMe and white boy Mac came to take them back\nWay back, back when people used to learn from rap\nI'm here to show you motherfuckers what I learn from Pac Slimm\nCouple rounds in the clip, down for burning that\nBeats I murder that, beef I murder that\nHe heard the shooter yell \"NNer!\" before he heard the mac\nAnd even if that nigga didn't bet he know it's them\nBlack with a little bit of brown like a doberman\nThat 1911 hold 11, go and call the 9-11\nHe just send his soul to heaven\nBitches say the shows is heaven, sitting in the front row\nTurned a couple Poly High games to the gun show\nTurned a couple Wilson High gangs to the track meet\nYou be in to rap beef 'cause you ain't never have beef\nJoey that's my brother, so I'm part of all of Fatts' beef\nAnd you know my strap, keep talking, that's my black bitch\n\n\n2-2-3 make a fat nigga back flip\nOne 16 wipe you niggas off the map quick\nNever had to show a lot of effort with the rap shit\nGoing for the kill cause I never really had shit\nSame old stereotype, got the stereo hype\nHope when I die that I'm buried like Mike\nEyes on that prize that ain't leavin' my sight\nIf you want that fire then he leaving tonight to show\nTwo claps when I see my yaNNcs\nTwo straps been moved that across the interstate\nArizona homies call me Flagstaff shortie\nChrome Kel Tec nine and a big black 40\nWe be shooting up the parties like we got no sense\nRide around the city trippin, we ain't got no tints\nHood been my home, I ain't got no rent\nWe be chillin' on the pop like we livin' on the pop\nNever slipping, I ain't trying to see the prison like my pops\nNever giving you a pass if I consider you a Op\nDon't consider you a threat if you ain't sending niggas shots\nGot some killas with me down to put a nigga in the dirt\nLight the candles on the curb, send a message to the cops\nSnitch niggas in the feds sending letters to the cops\nSo I never trust a soul, when they ask I'm never speaking\nMy Beretta Scott King strong and black as she could be\nTeam trying to gangrene like that old Max B\nOld French Montana, macaroni with the cheese\nYoung Joe Montana throwing bullets through your defense\nThey need Vince, you should put him on your team\nIf I die in these streets then consider me a martyr\nEnemy goes five-deep in the charger\nDown to shoot though cause I got that jumper\nBeen on that block this my 19th summer\nMomma playing Stevie Wonder in the kitchen while she cooking\nPigs knocking at the door to take my dad to central booking\nReading books up in my room cause she won't let me go and play\nScared her youngest son will run around and go pick up a K\nYou might also like\n\nFuck that shit you represent I'm here to get these presidents\nWouldn't be the only king to come up where the peasants live\nPray to God I never do the shit that both my parents did\nHistory repeats itself, it's up to me to change it\nWatch me burn the book of life and write the pages in my favor\nOn some King James shit\nCall me Mr. on some Rosewood Ving Rhames shit\nKeep a pistol in the Gap fleece\nWe aim quick, leave a nigga on the backstreets\nSame old shit, you heard Stuck In My Ways\nNo the show don't stop, I could do it for days\nIf you disrespect my family we all gon' fight\nSwinging like T Woods, trying to earn my stripes\nYeah that uppercut will fuck him up so say goodnight15Embed\nI'm here to tell the world I'm from Ramona park\nDiving in the deep water like I know the sharks\nClimbing in the king's daughter,

At the end of the day, I feel like the problem is the people that control it don't really come from there. So they can't do nothing but, you know, look down on us. We look up at them, we see somebody that could help; they look at us, and all they see is a nigga. But it don't really matter anyway. We all gon' die one day, man. One day.\n\nDo doves cry when a Black man die, or do we croak with crows?\nThe young catch gunshots, the old catch the Holy Ghost\nHo, I love not, I never seen no pot of gold\nJust bar windows and six-fours with no switches\nWas broke with no bitches; she love me, though\nYou'll kill me if it make you richer, what you screaming you my brother for?\nHeart is where the hatred is, the brain'll stain the love below\nAnd life is what you make it, so I'm making money for my folks\n\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make it up to Heaven, despite the things I've done\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make my mama proud, feel like her only son\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nWith everything I need, with everything I want\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo do it like nobody has ever done\n\nWhen most people look at a person who does what I do, they look at us with these preconceived notions, as if it's a set way for us all to be. But we all people at the end of the day, so I wonder why we don't treat each other like it. You looking at a person, telling them that they story don't matter, really, no better than me walking down the street tryna shoot at somebody, 'cause all we got is these dreams, man, and y'all ain't never had to not have nothing. And that's the last thing you want for anybody is to not really have nothing at all.\nI been through Hell and back, I seen my mama cry\nSeen my father hit the crack, then hit the set to flip a sack\nI done seen my homies die, then went on rides to kill 'em back\nSo how you say you feel me when you never had to get through that?\nWe live for they amusement, like they view us from behind the glass\nNo matter what we grow into, we never gon' escape our past\nSo in this cage they made for me, exactly where you find me at\nWhether it's my time to leave or not, I never turn my back\n\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make it up to Heaven, despite the things I've done\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make my mama proud, feel like her only son\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nWith everything I need, with everything I want\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo do it like nobody has ever done, nobody has ever done17Embed\nI tell it like it is, then how it could be\nLike it is, then how it could be\nI tell it like it\u2014 tell it how it\u2014\nI tell it like it\u2014 tell it how it\u2014\nI tell it like it is, then how it could be\nLike it is, then how it could be\nI tell it like it\u2014 tell it how it\u2014\nI tell it like it\u2014 tell it how it\u2014\nI tell it like it is, then how it could be\nLike it is, then how it could be\nI tell it like it\u2014 tell it how it\u2014\nI tell it like it\u2014 tell it how it\u2014\n\nHeaven or Hell, boy; freedom or jail, boy\nA Jansport bag full of shit I could sell for\u2014\nThe high or the low, boy, just me and my homeboys\nThe police kill us, so we made up our own laws\nBeen fighting this long war, it's shells in this shore sand\nStill young, but a grown man, could tell by my stature\nStacking money and problems as I wait for the Rapture\nDeath never been no threat, I be chilling, relaxing\nEverybody bleed\n\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make it up to Heaven, despite the things I've done\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make my mama proud, feel like her only son\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nWith everything I need, with everything I want\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo do it like nobody has ever done\n\nWhen I was in seventh grade, my grandfather taught me, \"Don't get caught loving the streets, 'cause they never gon' love you back.\" But I feel like it's all we got, so it's all we really do love. At the end of the day, I feel like the problem is the people that control it don't really come from there. So they can't do nothing but, you know, look down on us. We look up at them, we see somebody that could help; they look at us, and all they see is a nigga. But it don't really matter anyway. We all gon' die one day, man. One day.\n\nDo doves cry when a Black man die, or do we croak with crows?\nThe young catch gunshots, the old catch the Holy Ghost\nHo, I love not, I never seen no pot of gold\nJust bar windows and six-fours with no switches\nWas broke with no bitches; she love me, though\nYou'll kill me if it make you richer, what you screaming you my brother for?\nHeart is where the hatred is, the brain'll stain the love below\nAnd life is what you make it, so I'm making money for my folks\n\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make it up to Heaven, despite the things I've done\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo make my mama proud, feel like her only son\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nWith everything I need, with everything I want\nI gotta be, I gotta be, I gotta be the one\nTo do it like nobody has ever done\n\nWhen most people look at a person who does what I do, they look at us with these preconceived notions, as if it's a set way for us all to be. But we all people at the end of the day, so I wonder why we don't treat each other like it. You looking at a person, telling them that they story don't matter, really, no better than me walking down the street tryna shoot at somebody, 'cause all we got is these dreams, man, and y'all ain't never had to not have nothing.

father\nAll a nigga ever knew, if it wasn't for Rashard or Ray\nI probably would be shot today, they taught a loc survival\nMy teachers said I had a vibrant mind, but a tarnished shine\nDoing violent crimes, put the money in my pockets\nGave it to my mom, but when a nigga had a chance\nNever asked where it was from, happy that I lent a hand\nThe day my grandfather died, I grew into a man\nAround the same time I first pulled a trigger\nI prayed it didn't hit him, but after awhile I ain't care\nAs long as a nigga still here, right?\n\nNever had belief in Christ, cus in the pictures he was white\nSame color as the judge that gave my hood repeated life\nSentences for little shit, church I wasn't feeling it\nWhy the preacher charge tell us everything gon be alright\nKnew what it was for, still I felt that it was wrong\nTill I heard Chef call himself God in the song\nAnd it all made sense, cus we can't do shit\nBut look inside the mirror once it all goes wrong\nYou fix your own problems, tame your own conscience\nAll that holy water shit is nothing short of nonsense\nNot denying Christ, I'm just denying niggas options\nCus prayer never moved my Grandmama out of Compton\nI prayed for my cousin, but them niggas still shot him\nInvest in a gun, cause them niggas still got them\nAnd won't shit stop em from popping you in broad day\nHope that choir pew bulletproof or you gon' pay\nYou might also like\nMoney was the motive, Florence, California, cutting corners\nTrying catch a nigga slipping just to blaze him that Sabonis (what?)\nChamber long as Tommy Chambers nigga meet your maker\nAs-Salamu leave em lakeside, bells can't save em\nWhen them shells start raining, guess my mama didn't raise me right\nToo busy paying Christ to wash away her sins\nBut I'm the only one that's fucked up in the end?\nThat's the shit that happens when you put a book before your kids\nThe only girl I ever loved turned into a bitch\nIf I ever see her and I got a gun, she getting hit\nThat's as honest as it gets, I've done a lot of shit\nI ain't proud of, but I wouldn't trade it in for Heaven\n11 Mac-11's, and a Tre 57\nBet that shit will get to talking if you ever got a

stuffed\nBetter not slip, I'ma crash, yeah\nYou ain't shot shit, get your stats up\nKept the sticks lit, I'm a factor\nI was out there, when it mattered\nHad the chopstick with the ladder\nMade it count, made it to Atlanta\n\nOff of Camp Creek, with no plan C\nI was here first, understand me?\nYou gotta stay alert, understand me?\nIf they catch me, they gon' blast me\n\nYeah, bounce out, chunkin' up the hood\nMoney in the bank, so I'm feelin' good\nPulled up on the gang, never Hollywood\nShowin' em the way so they show a nigga love\nBut, these lil' niggas runnin' wild\nBought a .40 cal, out the Jordan Downs\nMarried to the streets, know she get around\nI never wanna leave, I'm never out of bounds, yeah\nAin't no peacin' up if you body one of us\nBody for a body, big body Benz truck\nBounce out boogie, play pussy, get fucked\nWhen these niggas get tough\nSince when these niggas want war with us?\nLick a gunshot, bloodshot corneas\nI been out all night tryna make it out\nSwear to God that the set was the safest route\nAnd what they about?\nYou might also like\nMoney, mantra\nHundred racks plus, duffle bag stuffed\nBetter not slip, I'ma crash, yeah\nYou ain't shot shit, get your stats up\nKept the sticks lit, I'm a factor\nI was out there, when it mattered\nHad the chopstick with the ladder\nMade it count, made it to Atlanta\n\nI took big risks, now I'm a big fish\nA billion dollars at the top of my to-do list\nBuy a villa in Saint-Barts, maybe a cruise ship, well, really a yacht\nJust to say that I got it, product of my environment\nKeep my cutter for the snakes, you know this shit can get slimy\nAin't have to make no call to gang'nem, they already beside me\nWhere the money at, that's more than likely where you can find me\nI can't honor that, you know that shit was flawed when you tried it\nThis shit crazy, nobody wanna put in the work but wanna get paid though\nI'ma keep on spendin' on lawyers until the case closed\nI'm probably not comin', I'm not the one you should wait on\nI want this shit bad, hope it don't take long\nEverybody callin' with they problem, not to check on me\nThey say, \"If it happened then it's meant to be,\" guess we'll see\nI knew you was lyin' when you had told me you would never leave\nI can't keep on goin' back and forth, I gotta let it be\nMoney, mansion\nHundred racks plus, duffle bag stuffed\nBetter not slip, I'ma crash, yeah\nYou ain't shot shit, get your stats up\nKept the sticks lit, I'm a factor\nI was out there, when it mattered...1Embed\nMoney, mantra\nHundred racks plus, duffle bag

Yeah I'm feeling the love\nHope I get to take it with me when my living is done\nPray to God that he forgive me for the sinning I've done\nAnd I hear you cheering for me when my victory come\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYeah I'm feeling the love\nYou might also like\n2006 I said I had to get my money right\nShit I refuse to hear my stomach growl another night\nMight put that burner right up in your mouth and free your mind\nThen run your pockets, I ain't stoppin' 'til my kids is fine\nCollege was a plan of mine until I seen them fees\nEverything I ever needed, I done learned out on them streets\nOnly price was loss of sleepin', homies plottin' so I keep it on me\nClosely play this game for keeps, I take the shot, you be the goalie\nGoals I gotta reach, but this girl up in my sheets asleep\nMom up on her way to work, if she say bye before she leave\nThen this my last day on this earth, I'm way too young for plantin' seeds\nIs what she used to tell me, shit, but when I ever listen?\nPlayed a lot of roles in life but never played the victim\nNever paid a toll for stripes, I earned them on them lonely nights\nMac rounds tear the house down like a poltergeist\nLife is what you make it, just depend on how you roll the dice\n\nIs you feeling amazing?

time and a place, swear to God I'll attend\nI should've took you to prom\u2014fuck whoever had did\nBut I was busy punching niggas in the face by the gym\nAnd you was right there\nYou was always right

I wander to sleep\nNever told you this, but you was why I went to seventh period\nTruant student, but you told me I should take it serious\nLosing you is just another demon that I'm living with\nStanding in your living room, meeting your fam'\nKnow it hurt you when they ask you, \"What had happened to him?\"\nWhen you see me on the TV, know I'm glad you my friend\nWish I had more, but I

you, I always think about our kids that you killed\nUnderstanding at the time, you didn't think we was real\nBut as a man, I feel I let you down\nWe was on our second child that you seen as a mistake before I got to reconcile\nAnd make you see the way I'd try to plan for us all\nWhen I look back at my life, I'm glad I had you involved\nIf I ever need somebody, you the first I'ma call\nSaid that you would do it all just to see me alive\nIn the back seat, Seal beats, tears in your eyes\nTold me they was tears of joy, still I think that's a lie\nBut whatever helped you walk in faith, you couldn't when you walked away\nSorry if you called me and I tell you, \"I can't talk today\"\nPain in my voice when I speak in these songs\nSame tone as the day I told you leave me alone\nBut I never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nNo, I never said I never had love for you\nI never

every night before I wander to sleep\nNever told you this, but you was why I went to seventh period\nTruant student, but you told me I should take it serious\nLosing you is just another demon that I'm living with\nStanding in your living room, meeting your fam'\nKnow it hurt you when they ask you, \"What had happened to him?\"\nWhen you see me on the TV, know I'm glad you my friend\nWish I had more, but I don't\nNever running out of hope\nReally, I'm just waiting on you\n\nBut I never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nNo, I never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\n\nAs for you, I always think about our kids that you killed\nUnderstanding at the time, you didn't think we was real\nBut as a man, I feel I let you down\nWe was on our second child that you seen as a mistake before I got to reconcile\nAnd make you see the way I'd try to plan for us all\nWhen I look back at my life, I'm glad I had you involved\nIf I ever need somebody, you the first I'ma call\nSaid that you would do it all just to see me alive\nIn the back seat, Seal beats, tears in your eyes\nTold me they was tears of joy, still I think that's a lie\nBut whatever helped you walk in faith, you couldn't when you walked away\nSorry if you called me and I tell you, \"I can't talk today\"\nPain in my voice when I speak in these songs\nSame tone as the day I told you leave me alone\n\nBut I never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nNo, I never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said I never had love for you\nI never said"
