II\u201d put the Mobb on the map and helped bring hardcore New York hip-hop back into the forefront while also influencing the hip-hop scene in France. Their two follow-up albums, Hell on Earth (1996) and Murda Muzik (1999) helped further solidify their status in the rap game as they received gold and platinum plaques.\n\nThe two released a number of projects as a duo as well as solo projects, and both of them released their own collaborative projects with their frequent collaborator The Alchemist.\n\nSadly, Prodigy passed away on June 20, 2017, in Las Vegas after being hospitalized during the Art of Rap Tour. May he rest in peace. See here for the Mass Appeal obituary."

Nahmsayin'?\nThat old real shit\n\nThere's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from\nYou could run, but you can't hide forever\nFrom these streets that we done took\nYou walkin' with your head down, scared to look\nYou shook, \u2018cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nThey never around when the beef cooks in my part of town\nIt's similar to Vietnam\nNow we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control\nThey better have the riot gear ready\nTryin' to bag me and get rocked steady!\nBy the MAC one-double, I touch you\nAnd leave you with not much to go home with\nMy skin is thick, \u2018cause I be up in the mix of action\nIf I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'\nNew York got a nigga depressed\nSo I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess\nGod bless my soul\nBefore I put my foot down and begin to stroll\nInto the drama I built\nAnd all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed\nPut us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk\nI'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me\nAnd if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me\nLord, forgive me, the Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act\nI'm fallin' and I can't turn back\nOr maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black\nThat I can't say, so it's left a untold fact\nUntil my death, my goal's to stay alive\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nYo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive (We still livin' it)\nWe livin' this 'til the day that we die\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\n(Thug life, we still livin' it)\nWe livin' this 'til the day that we die\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\n(We still livin' it)\nWe livin' this 'til the day that we die\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\n\nI'm trapped in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough\nY'know, when the dough get low, the jewels go\nBut never that! As long as fiends smoke crack\nI'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks\nNo doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution\nFive-O lurkin', no time to get lost in the system\nNiggas usin' fake names to get out quick\nMy brother did it and got bagged with two ounces\nI live a world where squads hit the block hard\nAsk my man Twin, when he got bagged, that fucked me up, God\nBut shit happens for a reason\nYou find out who's your true peoples when you're Upstate bleedin'\nYou can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you\nHit with a two-to-four is difficult\nWild on the streets, I try to maintain\nTight with my loot, \u2018cause hoes like to run game\nSome niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit\nI'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip\nPushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet\nNo matter how much loot I get, I'm stayin' in the projects forever!\nJakes on the blocks \u2014 we out-clever\nIf beef, we never separate, roll together\nWhen worst comes to worst, my peoples come first\nTry to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt\nMy crew's all about loot\nFuck lookin' cute! I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits\nPuffin' L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell\nIn the 'Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell\nYou better realize\nWe livin' this 'til the day that we die\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\n(We still livin' it)\nWe livin' this 'til the day that we die\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\n(Thug life, we still livin' it)\nWe livin' this 'til the day that we die\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\n(We still livin' it)\nWe livin' this 'til the day that we die\nSurvival of the fit, only the strong survive\n\nOpen your eyes and get wise\nLook alive, in '95, word up\nHypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed, nahmsayin'?\nMobb Deep and all that95Embed"

what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors\nHere come the D's, time to make breeze and guns toss\nIn full force, my team'll go at your main source\nMy 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage\nYour whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit\nBlood flood your eye, fuck up your optics\nSwitch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit\nYo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?\nNine pound, we rocked it\n'96, strike back with more hot shit\nIlluminate, my team'll glow like radiation\nWith no time for patient or complication\nLet's get it done right, my clique airtight\nTrapped in a never-ending gunfight\nSo niggas lose stripes or lose life\nJail niggas sendin' kites to the street\nOver some beef that wasn't fully cooked\nFinish 'em off, well-done meat\nThen send .22 slug to your head\nTravel all the way down to your leg\n\nAyo, it's Hell on Earth\nWhose necks are gonna be first?\nThe projects is front line\nAnd the enemy is one-time\nI ain't gotta tell you\nIt's right in front of your eyes\nAyo, it's Hell on Earth\nWhose necks are gonna be first?\nThe projects is front line\nAnd the enemy is one-time\nI ain't gotta tell you\nYo, it's right in front of your eyes\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nWe rep the QBC, nigga, rep yours, it's all love\nMilli' stacked down, heavily guarded by hollow-tip slug\nThen crack down on wannabe thugs\nAdapt to gat sound and bow down\nSlow the fuck up, see how my foul now\nArticulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit\nNever hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited\nSign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite\nThen reminisce twenty years later how we was gettin' it\nEither with me, go against the grain, you better hit me\nLeggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me\n\u2018Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches\nBitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures\n\u2018Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me\nAll that bullshit is just makin' me\nMore the better to concentrate on gettin' cheddar\nIf shorty set you up, you better dead her\nI told you, shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you\nLike a pimp, mind control you, double-edge blow you\nIn the B-I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal\nInternational, you local\nBacardi mix physically fix\nHit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff\nProbably thick, son, I solved 'em\nPulled him in my world and evolved him to chaos\nWalk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop\nQB City, Godfather Pt III\nGotti, Gambino, and Ty Nitty\nScarface, rest in peace\nWhose necks are gonna be first?\nThe projects is front line (Front line)\nAnd the enemy is one-time (One-time)\nI ain't gotta tell you\nAyo, it's right in front of your eyes\nHell on Earth\nWhose necks are gonna be first?\nThe projects is front line (Front line)\nAnd the enemy is one-time (One-time)\nI ain't gotta tell you\nAyo, it's right in front of your eyes\n\nYo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips\nYou see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split\nLayin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids\nTurn off his lights, switch to darkness\nIt's deep in the abyss of street life\nBlood on my kicks, shit on my knife\nYou's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice\nI was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet\nThe phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded\nShut down your operation, closed for business\nLeave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness\nP.O.W. niggas is found M.I.A.\nWe move like special forces, Green Beret\nHeavily around my throat, I don't play\nShit brand new, back in '89, the same way\nThe God P walk with a limp, see\nBut simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me\nTest me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me\nI had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty\nThe reason why it's full for so long 'cause I don't waste shit\nYou properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it\nQuiet is kept, I lay back and watch the world spin\nI hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb when they see us\nI tell you what, black, here's the issue\nIt's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles\nAlong with that, I ain't your average cat\nFuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that\nWhatever it takes, however it gots to go down\nFour mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four-pound\nSpeakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground\nI could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless\nBlow-for-blow, let's find out who hit hardest\nThis rap artist used to be a stickup artist\nSometimes I test myself, see if I still got it\nA live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit\nOr forget the essence from which I emerged\nP is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds (Nigga)\nLive up to my words, if I got beef, niggas comin' in herds (Nigga)\nWe flush through, your clique get purged (Word up)33Embed"

Situation like this\nAnother war story from a thirsty young hustler\nWon't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya\nAnd leave your corpse for the cops to discover\nWhile I be pimpin' in the Range Rover, all jewelled like Liberace\nYou watch me while Jakes tryna knock me and lock me\nBut I be on the low sippin' Asti Spumante\nNiggas tried to creep on the side of my Jeep\nStuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep\nOver a 3-pack \u2014 it was a small thing really, yeah\nBut keep lettin' them small things slide and be a failure\nIf I'm outta town, one of my crew'll take care of ya\nThe world is ours, and your team's inferior\nYou wanna bust caps? I get all up in your area\nKidnap your children, make the situation scarier\nLife is a gamble, we scramble for money\nI might crack a smile, but ain't a damn thing funny\nI'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy\nPlus, the outcome turns out to be lovely\nGot cheese in my pocket, hit off my main squeeze\nPush back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze\nThrough the butter-soft leather upholstery\nBut mostly, keep the gat closely 'cause niggas wanna toast me\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nA-yo, I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences\nCount all my blessings, add up my weapons\nCock back the gat and let my 9 serve purpose\nSling, do my thing, organize fiend servants\nTryna make a mill is stress, you know the deal\nSo we sling krills, get your cap peeled, 'cause everythin' is real\nCuz, I wanna chill, laid up in a Jacuzzi\nSippin' bubbly, with my fingers on the Uzi\nTry to infiltrate my fort, get caught, dead up in New York\nMy brain is packed with criminal thoughts\nGet your life lost, never found again, my friend\nMission completed, watch you drop in less than ten\nOn my road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches\nYour last restin' place'll be a ditch, kid!\nNo one can stop me \u2014 try, your style's sloppy\nYou wanna be me? You're just an imitation copy\nMy theme is all about makin' the green\nLivin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably\n\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together, son, your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shines to light up the sky\nWe in this together, son, your beef is mine\nA drug dealer's dream:\nStash C.R.E.A.M., ki's on a triple beam\n500 SL green, '95 nickle gleam\nCondominium, thug dressed like a gentleman\nTailor-made ostrich, Chanel for my woman friend\nMurderin', numbers on your head while I'm burglarin'\nShank is servin' 'em\nWhat's up to all my niggas swervin' in New York metropolis\nThe 'Bridge brings apocalypse\nShoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watchin' us\nMad man, my sanity is goin' like a hourglass\nGun inside my bad hand I sliced tryna bag grams\nI got hoes that used to milk you\nNiggas who could've killed you is down with my ill crew of psychos\nNas Escobar movin' on your weak production\nPumpin' corruption in the third world, we just bustin'!\n\nHold up and analyze \u2014 the wild cats sling cracks, they swing in Ac's\nThe new routines be my eyes\nBlacks playin' corners, glancin' all up in your cornea\nCorner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya\nBut late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe\nIt's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane, right?\nWord, yo, I wanna get this money then blow\nTake my time, blast a nine, if you front, you go\nSip beers \u2014 the German ones, hand my guns to sons\nShaolin and Queensbridge \u2014 we robbin' niggas for fun\nBut still, write my will out to my seeds then build\nMahalia sing a tale, but the real, we still kill!\nWHAT!\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together, son, your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shines to light up the sky\nWe in this together, son, your beef is mine\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together, son, your beef is mine\nSo long as the sunshine can light up the sky\nWe in this together, son, your beef is mine\n\nUhhhh!

I heard they got you on the run for a body\nNow it's time to stash the guns\nThey probably got the phones tapped, so I won't speak long\nGimme a hot second, and I'ma put you on\nIt's all messed up, somebody snitchin' on the crew\nAnd word is on the street is they got pictures of you\nHomicide came to the crib last night, six deep\nAskin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep\nThey said they just wanna question you, but me and you know\nThat once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you\nThen arraign you, hang you, I don't think so\nIt's a good thing you bounced for now, just stay low\nOnce in a blue, I check to see how you're doin'\nI know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union\nThey'd probably knock down the door\nIn the middle of the night, sometimes around four\nHopin' to find who they lookin' for, but they won't succeed\nAll they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed\nBut word, son, you got the projects hotter than hell\nHarder for brothers to get they thug on, but oh, well\nSon, they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks\n\"Oh, you heard who did what?\" \u2014 No, I don't know who did shit!\nSo stop askin', and I know I'm not goin' crazy\nFrom windows, I see lights flashin' and maybe\nSomebody's takin' pictures, you know who that be\nPolice lovers, and neighborhood snitches\nThey put up a G, so everybody's pointin' fingers, and lyin'\nA-yo, son!

Hold your head wherever you at\nOn the flow from the cops with wings on your back\nThat snitch nigga gave police your location\nWe'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation\nKilla, listen, shit ain't the same without you at home\nPhony niggas walk around, tryna be your clone\nThey really fear you, when you was at home, they was pale\nThat's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail\nBy the time you hear this rhyme, you'll probably be locked up\nTried to hide, somewhere along the lines, your plans slipped up\nGot caught up in a crime that you can't take back\nReminiscin' how I used to pick you up in the Ac'\nYears ago, when we was younger\nSeemed the hood took us under very deep\nWonderin' who snitchin' got me losin lots of sleep at night\nYou know my mouth is tight\nI never sang to the cops 'cause that shit ain't right!\nSometimes, I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack\nDamn! Why the situation go down like that?\nIt'll be a long time before the heat dies down\nAnd a couple of years 'fore we see you around\nBut 'til then, maintain and keep your story the same\nThe cops is grabbin' wrong niggas, lookin' for someone to blame\nThey harassin', strugglin' to find the truth\nThere's a chance ya case'll get thrown out 'cause they ain't got no proof\nTo say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy\nDeliver me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river\nMake sure it sinks to the bottom\nOutsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em!\nBut still..

A nigga just died last week\nAs he swore he was grown and he's a thug in the street\nBut it's like that! My crew pump cracks and we pack MAC\nHis eyes is wild with the rezzy monkey on his back\nBut I'm stressed, and he need to be blessed with a firepack\nDon't even go there 'cause it ain't like that\nSlow down, baby\nHe said, \"What? You tryna play me? You must be crazy!\"\nPulled out the heat and almost blazed me\nThen he was Swayze, the shot must've dazed me\nThug sellin' drugs, bustin' slugs, but he ain't crazy27Embed"

About to get my thug on\nThe 41st side of things\n\nI used to be in love with this bitch named E&J\nDon't fuck with her no more, now I fuck with Tanqueray\nTanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold (Yeah, that bitch)\nLast name was English, and the first name Olde\nBut Gold couldn't take the dick, it made me lazy\nWe split apart, and now I met this new trick Dainy\nNow me and Dainy, we been together ever since\nOur love combines to form a science, what is this?\nI bust her cherry, took her virginity in '91 (Word)\nNow that she's open, everybody want to tap somethin'\nGo get your own, don't make me have to fuckin' clap somethin'\nI love my shorty more than life, now ain't that somethin'?\nTo love you, Dainy, more than livin' itself\nEven though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health\nWhen I go pick her up, they tell me, \"Put her back on the shelf\"\nThey say, \"Yo, P! She only wants you for one thing \u2014 that's your wealth\"\nBut I don't pay attention, 'cause she's my baby, the Dainy\nYou know she drive me crazy, she's my number one lady\nMet her back in '89, now she's 22, actin' like she 40 (Word)\nShe said \"All I need is a man to support me\nBesides, you from the 41st side of things (Uhh)\nAnd Queensbridge niggas be actin' like they kings\nPushin' Lexuses, wearin' fat diamond rings\"\nMy cellular phone reigns supreme, international, think rational\nThe 12th Street crew \u2014 move back when we come through!\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nI think the whole world's goin' insane\nI fill my brain up with Dainy, and drink away the pain\nI think the whole world's goin' insane\nI fill my mind up with liquor, and drink away the pain (Yeah, yeah)\nI think the whole world's losin' its brain\nI fill my brain up with liquor, and drink away the pain (What, what)\nI think the whole world's goin' insane\nI fill my mind up with Dainy, and drink away the pain\n\nTommy Hil' was my nigga, and others couldn't figure\nHow me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor\nHad to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures\nSaid a Brinks is comin' through, at Fashion Avenue\nAt Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew\nOf motherfuckers, who ain't goin' out like suckers\nTold me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers\nI told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker\n\"Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers\"\nDiesel drove the the Bimmer, the hatchback of course\nNautica'll navigate to keep us on course\nPolo's actin' bolo, tryin' to say he the Boss\nI said shut the fuck up! (Nahmean?) The kid is out with the loot sack (Word)\nGot a big trey pound, itchin' just to swoop back\nTimb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle\nScope is on the top, so you know he livin' Eiffel\nTook the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the Face!\nAll them other kids, they had they tools aimed at space\nLevi had the snub, so you know they gettin' laced\nDonna Karan was cryin' 'cause mad shells was flyin'\nDamn, all we want is a piece of the pie and\nNike scooped the sacks 'cause he moves like Air\nThrew them shits up in the trunk, now we up out here\nGot back to the mansion to divvy up the paper\nHelly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper\nSo she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice\nEverybody in the crew didn't think it was nice\nI guess not! And Guess was hot, so guess what? (What?)\nGuess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut!\nWhen you play with crime, sometimes it's not too fly\nEven though the goods look deceivin' to the eye\nThe end situation could leave your ass fried (Yo, a-yo)\nThat's why you got to walk on by, walk on by\nWalk on by, walk on by, walk on by\n(Yo, bring that Dainy home, man)\n\nMy man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock\nNow, Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop\nOne sip, I thought the bitch was a fuckin' warlock\nThe more she started givin' me, the stronger I got\nPushed her off to the crew, then she started gettin' jealous\nSteamed 'cause I spent more C.R.E.A.M. with the fellas\n\"Fuck them niggas! Spend that cheese on me\nSee if they be around when you need pussy\"\nThen I thought to myself, \"Yo, this trick is right!\"\nGathered up all my dough, so I spent the night\nI can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock\nNiggas started riffin', \"Why you trickin'? Yo, this shit must stop!\"\nMoms like \"You need to see the AA\nBetter hope they help your ass out on the same day\"\nBut never that, I got the shakes so I need that\nSon call me stressed out, I just be that\nBut when it comes to Henn Rock, dunn, I need that\nShe's my shorty for life, so fuck the feedback\nI think the whole world's goin' insane\nI fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain\nI think the whole world's lost its brain\nI sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain\n\nTo all the brothers who ain't here\nPour a little somethin' on the floor\nTime to get a little bent, do our thing\nWord up! The 41st side of Queens gettin' bent, know what I mean?\nIt's an everyday thing\nHenny got my mind in a headlock, Dainy got me goin' crazy\nDainy take me away, Dainy take me away28Embed"

No days\nSon, get the heat, 'cause I'm about to stick him\n(Fuck that shit, yo, if that nigga front, yo, hit him!)\nAight, bet, so just hold it down\nWhile I cock back the long three pound\nYou're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming\nJust the right time, kid, it's twelve in the evening\nYou're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye\nThought you was safe and got caught by surprise\n\"What's going on?\" as I reply\n\"Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide\"\nHe tried to play tough so I put one in his brain\nEven though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain\nCome through truck without heat, how you figure?\nWhen you in the projects, keep your fingers on the trigger\nBut fuck that, we juxing\nIf you got what we like, it gets tooken\nPut you on your back, send you on your way, yo, good looking\nNow we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn\nGetting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up\nGot the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up\nGet your motherfucking shit swoll up\nNow it's back to Queens to serve fiends\nMaking G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies\nSipping Hennessy, with my mind on some crime shit\nOne-time searching me, but never ever find shit\nIt's the everyday, get the loot then breeze\nThough my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's\nBut all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave\nFuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease\nDon't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure\nI get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas\nPulling the trigger when the drama appears\n'Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear\nSo, yo....\nCheck it out, check it out, check it out, yo\nTrife life got me thinking like an animal\nNo doubt, no doubt, no doubt, no doubt, yo\nWhat can kill you is what you don't know20Embed"

Bustin' nuts?\nCats heard of me in street stories caught inside this trap\nWho are you to look at me with your eyes like that?\nWisen up, young blood, before you make things escalate\nAnd I would hate to set your crooked ass straight\n\nMake your moves at night\nPack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife\nRunnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip\nMake one false move and it's a up north trip\nLivin' the high life, make your moves at night\nPack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife\nRunnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip\nMake one false move and it's a up north trip\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nYou tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked\nYou talk too much shit, you shoulda kept your mouth shut\nAll that gossip, motherfucker, don't you know my Glock kicks\nHollow tips, to your body, mad toxic?\nI fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor\nDid you a favor, tried to wet you but I graze you\nPop goes the Glock when there's beef on the block\nChill for a while, make them think the beef stop\nThen I creep like a thief in the night, it's only right\nAin't no turnin' back, it's on tonight\nAnd if I get caught, then my ass is up north\nStraight on a course for Upstate New York\nStressed, smokin' back to back cigarettes\nIn pop', dawg, on-point in the mess hall\nBut to avoid that, from head-to-toe dipped in all-black\nHit them niggas where they pump they cracks at\nHavoc, with the murder master plan\nKeep my 9 up to par so my shit won't jam\nGod forbid if my shit do\nRun behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you\nSlugs in your body, mainly in your brain tissue\nDitch from the scene, get ghost, stash the pistol\nSo simple, then watch my back, lay up and relax\nRoll a sack K-A, black, find a shorty to tap\nLivin' the high life, make your moves at night\nPack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife\nRunnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip\nMake one false move and it's a up north trip\nLivin' the high life, make your moves at night\nPack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife\nRunnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip\nMake one false move and it's a up north trip\n\nI got the powder, combine wit' the powder, and water\nIt oughta, drop in a half and hour\nIn the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil\nKeep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil\nThen I pause.. and ask God why\nDid he put me on this Earth just so I could die\nI sit back and build on all the things I did wrong\nWhy I'm still breathin', and all my friends gone\nI try not to dwell on the subject for a while\n'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle\nBut my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries\nAnd I can't turn it back, it's a part of me\nToo late for cryin', I'm a grown man strugglin'\nTo reach the next level of life without fumblin' down or foldin'\nI got no shoulder to lean on but my own\nAll alone in this danger zone\nTime waits for no man, the streets grow worse\nFuck the whole world, kid, my money comes first\n'Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody\nIf you're not family, then you die by me\n'Cause niggas will have you locked up\nThe snitch be your man\nGivin' police the run down on your plans\nBut never goin' down like that\nSo I, shut my mouth and hold my words back\nIllegal business, forever mines, fuck payin' taxes\nThe last kid that shitted and gave police access\nTo my blueprints, used names as evidence\nSkipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since\nThe moral of the story is easy to figure out\nA lesson that you can't live without\nLivin' the high life, make your moves at night\nPack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife\nRunnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip\nMake one false move and it's a up north trip\nLivin' the high life, make your moves at night\nPack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife\nRunnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip\nMake one false move and it's a up north trip18Embed"

One-time's comin' always (Yeah!)\nThey locked me up for 12 days, I can't comprehend\nNow I'm a free man on the streets again\nChasin' St. Ides down with some Seagram's Gin\nLife is like a dice game, and I'm in to win\n\nOn the scene, from the 41st side of Queens (Yeah!)\nWe get the C.R.E.A.M., laid up, love-love redeem\n'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim king\nDoin' my thing, throughout states my name'll ring\n\nTo all my peoples locked down, comin' back to life\nIn the world once again, though ya bid was trife\nWhile you was gone, we was goin' to war\nAnd even more, saw my man layin' dead on the floor\nKid, I swore that our crew'd live forever, I guess I was wrong\nNo, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (Yeah)\nYo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?)\nSweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' 'cross 12th Street\nJust as I approached the block\nI spotted Jake on the creep down by Vic's weed spot (Say word?)\nMade a U-ey up the hill, plus a change of plans\nI had to.. hurry back so I could warn my mans\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nIt had me stressed a little somethin', had my heart rapidly pumpin'\nNiggas started cuttin', behind the bushes duckin'\nMy ears rung, I plunged a clip into the guns\nGot grazed in the arm, one slug hit my son\nHe was bleedin' from the head, I couldn't believe it\nWe was defeated, if it was a case, I couldn't beat it\nFelt like cryin' (The temperature's risin'!)\nI saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'\nSo to P I passed the iron\n\nKid, you ain't lyin'\nI went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin'\nOn a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap!\nPolice buckin' at me, they tried to twist my dome back\nJetted up the staircase to the third floor\nReach behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor\nLock the door, police grab me up and try to break my jaw\nSaid, \"Where's the gun we saw?\" (I don't know)\n\"We know you was there at the homicide scene\"\n(I don't know nothin')\n\"And if it wasn't you, it was somebody from ya team\"\n\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n(From the cradle to the grave!)\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n(From the cradle to the grave!)\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n(From the cradle to the grave!)\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n(Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave!)\nYo, it's the reals, drama kills\nNobody move, stand still\nBody you, drop that ass off in the landfills\nSon blessed me with the iron, I got beef with\nSome niggas from the other side over some weak shit\nLoad up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips\nFlip 'em like the Gotti clique, my crew strictly body shit!\nThe cradle to the grave is where I'll end up\nFuck gettin' sent up North, son, I'm bent up!\nDoin' my dirt on the low\nFuckin' with the Mobb is like a trial, no doubt you gonna blow\nYou never know, he didn't even have to go\nThere, unprepared, now he's six below\nY'know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings\nGet that money I want, some brothers wanna act funny\nBut it's all good! I still die for the hood\n(For my peoples!) Yeah, knock on wood!\n\nTriple L, rollin' dice while I put you on\nTo the drama, what I gotta say is short, not long\nThis nigga that I'm beginnin' to dislike, he got me fed\nIf he doesn't discontinue his bullshit, he might be dead!\nYou know him well, and probably go way back\nBut I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that\nI hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I'll screw him\nHe shitted on my man, and we got plans to do him\nLets get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin'\nAin\u2019t no fear over here, dear, we just debatin'\nOn when and how, later or right now\nSpoke to Killa yesterday, he said to chill for a while\nBut it's hard actin' like everything is alright\nI get the chills when I see that nigga in my eyesight\nA dead man walkin', not only that, he's still talkin'\n(About what?) About how and what he did very often\nYou don't know how much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin\nOne day \u2014 my man, and the next \u2014 he's not\nDidn't know him long anyway, so fuck it!\nIt's funny how things change (Word up!)\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n(From the cradle to the grave!)\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n(From the cradle to the grave!)\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n(From the cradle to the grave!)\nFrom the cradle to the grave\n(Straight from the motherfuckin' cradle to the grave!)\n\nWord up, man!\nY'knowhatumsayin'? We gonna die!\nIt's for real, kid! No games bein' played17Embed"

Nigga, overcook that meat!\nGet no sleep, only rest is in between the blink\nMy life story was written in blood, permanent ink\nKiller instinct, R.I.P. 'em\nGotta think like that 'cause forever I be needin' 'em\nPlan flawless, mistakes never repeatin' 'em\nSome love me, some hate me, bitches in the head beatin' 'em\nNiggas wanna ride by the crib all slow\nWe clap, motherfucker! Want a real rap show?\nFiends are rushin' when the MAC blow, dead in my castle\nAnd in the blink, watch how quick life pass you\n\nWhat's wrong with motherfuckers? When will they ever learn?\nKeep playin' with that fire, and that ass is gettin' burned\nFuckin' with semi-auto's, one foot is in the grave\nWe givin' all of y'all somethin' to be afraid of\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nLet me tell you how it's goin' down!

You don't think I live a pop life now?\n'Cause hey! You could get popped right now\nMe don't play, I keep a gun around my way\n'Cause I'm a fuckin' drama king like my nigga Kay Slay\nSex, drugs, money and murder all day\nIt's rules, guidelines and codes we obey\nDon't even trip, IMD the set I claim\nInfamous Mobb Deep, nigga, ready to bang\nNigga don't think shit stink?

The bitch is bad, chill, son, she got me tempted\nReminiscing the fatty, jumped in the ride I rented\nFresh Timbs, Mecca dice well presented\nSippin E&J straight, was bent when I entered\nGave her a hug, stared her straight into her mug\nSee, ain't seen the bitch since back then and that was bug\nTurned the VCR on, Friday, my favorite flick\nOffered me a drink, Aliz\u00e9, I take a sip (No doubt)\nGot into convo, \"How you been over the years?\"\n\"Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear\"\n\"What you mean? I thought you left that cat,\" which was true\n\"I'm not talkin' about him, another dude\nBeen with him for a year and had a baby by him\nMatter fact, you saw him downstairs, you walked by him\"\nNow I'm thinking setup, could it be? Or maybe not\nShe said, \"Don't sweat it, he don't got the top lock\"\nTried to play it cool, but in my head, shorty's wildin'\nUsin' me to get the next nigga jealous, called up the fellas\nTy Nitty line was busy, so I beeped Gotti\nGotti was with Trip and two other grimeys\nThe Twins, \"Let me begin, then explain\nI'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed\nStuck without a gat, not prepared for combat\"\nGave the address, told my son there's more cats\nBe there in a second, big gats, no half steppin'\nThey flippin' on me, talkin' 'bout I never learn my lesson\nI laugh in additional, hit them with the math\nHung up the jack while shorty soaked in the bath\nPlayed the living room, dozed off for a second\nWhen I woke up, shorty was standing ass-naked\nMake moves, all this bullshit, pussy better be good\nStepped to the room, threw off my Champion hood\nSlow motion, all along, bent off the potion\nShorty went down and had a nigga wide open\nIt was over, laid up in the cut, I heard a thump\nJumped up, threw on my boxers, yo, what the fuck?\nAll the sudden, I saw this Black motherfucker\nWith this big-ass gat and two other motherfuckers (What the fuck?)\nBlack masks, clutching duct tape, no escape\nTied me up, smacked me all in my face\nShorty wasn't even screamin', looked up, saw 'em schemin'\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this\"\nAll bloodied up, shook the fuck up, held for ransom\nThey yelled, \"Got the bones,\" smiled, then started dancin' (Yeah)\nThe phone rung, it was my sons, they let 'em know they had me hostage\nThrew me on the phone, said, \"Son, don't worry, yo, we got this\"\nRegardless what the outcome all this bullshit\nTake a nigga word, don't ever go see a bitch, wordSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like6Embed"

this together son your beef is mine\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shine can light up the sky\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\n\nFirst of all the foundation, money is the root of all evil\nThe cream will have you shitting on your people\nLiving like lotto, everything is everything\nAin't nothing changed but the clothes that my money bring\nI'm Making figures that I never thought was possible\nYou try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital\nMy crew got the army of Tec-xuses and the Mac-uras\nKid you'll get your cap peeled backwards\nFor years, I've been trying to blow for years\nGetting bent off Mo\u00ebt, spending a G on beers\nLiving life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet\nTil the coke oil drop to the bottom of the pot\nMy invincible crew will never stop\nIf you looking, you can find me rising to the top\nI'm a classic, approach my level and get your ass kicked\nFloating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic\nIm trying to make a half a million triple in size\nBefore my eyes, another part of my team died\nI can still hear his voice while he up in the sky\nWhile the rest still living steady telling me lies\nIt's like a bad dream and I can't wake up\nBut at the same time I love it and I can't give it up\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nI got your life in arms reach, With a slug for each and any\nThe clip is filled up I'm hitting til its fucking empty\nPresenting, the hollow tip crew, take heed to the message that we sending at you\nChoking off your own blood watch you face turn blue\nAin't that some shit, the damage that a bullet can do\nMake you change the way you thinking, niggas speed while you blinking, too late\nOn your way home, you left a trail leaking\nI bet you next time you'll listen up while I'm speaking\nNow you're laid up in ICU for the weekend\nAt the same time I'm outside getting my thug on\nThe same eyes got my mind fucking bugging\n\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shine can light up the sky\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\n\nA drug dealer's dream:\nStash CREAM, keys on a triple beam\nFive hundred SL green, ninety-five nickle gleam\nCondominium, thug dressed like a gentleman\nTailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend\nMurdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring\nShank is serving 'em, what's up to all my niggas swerving in\nNew York metropolis, the Bridge brings apocalypse\nShoot at the clouds feels like, the holy beast is watching us\nMad man my sanity is going like a hourglass\nGun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams\nI got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you\nIs down with my ill crew of psychos\nNas Escobar moving all your weak production\nPumping corruption in the third world we just busting\nMy teams hot collecting mad cream, we slingshot\nMy ring's rock icy like a fuck with a green drop\nCall me santa with more snow than montana\nCamouflage Wu emblem on my bandana\nPlay fair sight, never in a million these cats bite\nFolding under pressure like beach chairs\nDrug money, hundred dollar nights plus flights around the way\nBurning biggys on bikes its only right\nTwo for fives 95, five 25s didn't I\nRewind glaciers mixtape niggas throwing eyes\nCheck dates, my whole crew making they Tec's spray\nShooting ninas off sideways we know it\n\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shine can light up the sky\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nBeat downs galore, kids walk away holding they jaws\nWishin they had yours, tours posters plus sneaker stores\nBalls be gettin licked kid on whatever airline\nRestroom style courtesy from stewardess, the bitch washed mine\nShellbox nines never been popped, Knowledge Bill shots\nIsraelis be hittin me, Bing's death made the store hot\nJewels gleam, niggas beam, whole team labelled wally king\nGoldie brought a pair, Chinese man dot him with the green\nWorld's greatest, Las Vegas payed us, rap crusaders\nCasino champs, Gods sport the latest\nToday's math, fuck nuthin but ass, take Cristal baths\nGo half on his robbery, we run up on Johnny Cash\nKid's invicible, back to back screws, Wu's suspenseful\nYou get lynched, starks will play it cool like a mint\nLike a night out, whitey's callin me like a double date\nAlkies get the shanks, yo it's swine inside Hostess cakes\nYo my man, check the moral or get deaded\nYou bust a shot and that big bullet was unleaded\nWord up\nAs time goes by, an eye for an eye\nWe in this together son your beef is mine\nSo long as the sun shine can light up the sky\nWe in this together son your beef is mine4Embed"

Some people call it instinct\nI like to call it my luck, who gives a fuck\nI'm stuck, in this environment and can't depart from it\nAnd if I try I always end up back where I started\nPlan A, square 1, there's no escapin'\nSo I've come to realize my truth\nTryna live my full life before my time is through\nClocks tickin', so I don't got no time for you\nAs I head outside, amongst the rest of the animals\nIs where I feel relaxed and safe and I can stand still\nIt's sorta like a family bond\nWe gather up all the soldiers and form into an invincible\nSwarm of kids, now it's on again\nDrinking straight from the bottle warm gin dripping down my chin\nFor the crippled children, you can't win against 25 niggas bent up with mac 10 semi-automatics, fully-addicted crime addicts\nSo long as there is cash involved, I gotta have it\nThere's many different levels to the criminal mind\nEither you in it for the money or you wasting your time\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nMy destiny will be the death of me\nForever loving my peoples\nHustling, It's only right, nigga we struggling to survive\nIt's only crime that provides for me\nSo I resort to puffing dimes and dreaming of pushing a ride\nNegative thoughts fill my brain but it's the projects to blame\nNiggas forever getting loot while standing out in the rain\nSo when the sun shine, nigga will be writing a rhyme\nAnd if a nigga owing, blood is how I'm taking mine\nAs I climb the ladder, of success with TEC's\nThough I rather not have to watch my back get threat\nBut it's like that, so I adjust, fuck getting touched\nYour man wasn't aware, that's why that nigga got bucked\nI realize open my eyes once this shit got real\nThere's mad drama on the Hill when niggas getting blue steel\nI love my niggas for that, we keep it real, get loot\nAnd our identity is Timbs and army certified suits\nMost def, my people hold me down whenever in beef\nTalking all that bullshit but it's the gats that rules the streets\nSurvival of the fittest automatics recommended\nGiven a life sentence to crime until my life is ended\n\nNiggas wanna point guns in my face, so what?\nI'm taking mines in blood\nNiggas forever talking shit, so what?\nI'm taking mines in blood\nTry to jam me on pack, so what?\nI'm taking mines in blood\nNiggas running out their mouth, so what?\nI'm taking mines in blood\nHow we do it, how we do it\nWe taking ours in blood. (x2)\nThis city got me trapped like an animal with criminal thoughts\nI can't seem to turn away from this unknown force\nIf only I can lay my hands on the source of my trouble\nAnd maybe I can heal my scar before it bubble\nIt's like a plague, and there ain't no cure\nWe absorb this world's filth, therefore we're un-pure\nMy life is like a bad dream I can't seem to shake\nOnly my peoples who are equal understand or relate\nThe way we live is never planned, it just happened that way\nSo until tomorrow I'll just be surviving today\nIt's just another man, on this planet living for delf\nPops gone, I had to learn to be a man myself\nBut I, don't stress that\nHe did his dirt, now he pays back waiting in a federal laid back\nPops, times is different and things ain't the same\nIt's worse than ever, to get paid we do whatever\nSee some rather achieve goals and be a scholar\nI rather get locked like you, earning a 6-digit dollar\nMaking the desert bird holler\nDoing white collar crimes, but the fed time is hard to swallow\nAnd digest so I protest the pen\nI rather die before the jail cell sucks me in\nAnd my peoples we all share the same thinking\nWe in synch, on the same tempo, making cowards run petro\nPull out the TEC, automatic metro\nMy shots chase you 'round corners\nLeaving your family a bunch of mourners\nAnd my all-around point as that\nIf you feel me you're guaranteed something you can feel back\nKid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me\nYou tried to blow me your weak side just showed me\nStepped out my door on 41st Side at 12,\nDidn't see my crew around so I got bent for self\nI had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9\nIt was a Friday night project housing had it bad one time\nCause niggas getting bagged on a regular son\nD's like \"Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,\"\nSo I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking\nNiggas be ass talking then fall victim of extortion\nHold myself down the only way I know\nNiggas pumping packs for free, in debt cause they owe\nStreet life is like a trial, ass out if you blow\nThe maximum is death son you know how that go\nLye got me on point, paranoid for life\nThat's why I walk the street with heat especially at night\nI represent the North side I hold the title with pride\nAnd when its on, I use the infra-red for guide\nAim it at your temple, with no remorse and never sentimental\nMy crew is cold-hearted from all the foul shit we been through\nSurviving shootouts, bullets hitting the fence sparking\nFuck my fingers, with guns niggas I'm marking til the blocks darkened\nDoing my thing, let my gun clap\nIt's like that!9Embed"

I be in the zone\nGazin' at the walls, depressed, iggin' the phone\nThey take it personal\nBut only a minor few can understand what this nigga feelin'\n41st 'til I die, motherfucker! (No doubt) I'm still breathin'\nYou a mutt, son, we full bred, you ain't my dog\nTryin' to infiltrate my clique, is you? I get wit' you!\nHandle that on a later note\nWe o'er-dose, every day to death we so close\nI'm tryin' to tell these cats, but I let 'em do they thing\nReady for the bad news 'til the phone ring\nSon is dead, now I'm in way over my head, seekin' revenge, son\nBent, son, on your behalf tryin' to laugh\n\nCheck out the drill, dunn \u2014 conceal guns, play the hum\nFor real, son's leanin' back, checkin' out the action\nOn the benches, we drinkin' X's\nYo, twirl dat shit while I spark this chocolate\nBurn it down like an arsonist\nPull out the miz 'cause it's time to bring the biz to kids\nAnd blow all hellfire out ya empire\nYour livest wire couldn't make my Mobb expire or retire\nI'm lettin' off 'til my arms tire\nI sit quiet wit' my head full of riot\nOur buyers, it's clear for your ear to hear\nI declared only live niggas rap this year\n'96 \u2014 I lost my dun, '97 \u2014 it got worse\nFuck it, somebody out the team gotta get murked\nAnd sat down, you play the background when shots sound off\nFlashin' back on how my mans is gone\nK.B. forever in my memory\nI spill some Henny then I keep it movin'\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nYo, do our thing, hold it down, we got this, lockin' this\nAin't nobody stoppin' this, Rakim and Infamous\nRep the hood for you and yours, no doubt, crash the boards\nAnd you don't really wanna go against the source\n\nSurprise! Open your eyes! Peep the foulness! The wildness!\nIt's bugged, niggas thugs in the projects, true Holiday thugs\nEase up! All that illin' and grillin'? Get ya melon lit up!\nY'all niggas is butt, you want me? I'm right in QB, what?!\nWhere you find me at, sippin' Cognac from a cup\nWith my heat next to my nuts\nNever afraid to pull it and bust\nSlug rushes to your head like dust, but that wasn't enough\nThis one was kind of tough, he squeezed back\nBetter believe he no longer breathe, black\nFuckin' with these Queens cats\nI got dreams raisin' my little queen, and nobody gonna stop that!\nIn fact, black, if you come at me, don't come sloppy\nAll my baby girl got is a papi\nTo guide her through this world of hatred\nAnd I'd die to see that she make it\nAnd die to let the next man take it? Is you stupid?!\nVerse 4: Rakim\nYo, you wanna come test? Son, it's massive stress\nPenalties of death, pay your last respects\nWe harass your rep if you slept or half-stepped\nWe adapt to see what we can master next\nAfter sex, pass the bless for after-effects\nRelax the stress, do math and set mad connects\nCash the check, to get assets, we blast TEC's\nDealin' with the mental aspects of chess\nSo retreat your troops, if you dunns come to shoot\nGet greeted by a twenty-one gun salute\nI keep 'em leery of the deadly \"7 MC\" theory\nSoon as they hear me, I release Lyrics of Fury\nI'm quick to say a poem that ricochet in your dome\nMy clique made me leave the nickel-plated at home\nSo I can get the cheddar, and be the better trendsetter\nThe 18th Letter forever, what!\nDo our thing, hold it down, we got this, lockin' this\nAin't nobody stoppin' this, Rakim and Infamous\nRep the hood for you and yours, no doubt, crash the boards\nAnd you don't really wanna go against the source6Embed"

(You gotta find a way to deal with)\nYou're dealin' with the peer pressure\n\nAs a young black teen, everyday I, deal\nWith the pressure, and mixed up is how I feel\nI walk the streets with a 'Fuck you!' attitude\nAnd when it comes to my peoples, you ain't half as rude\nFollow the crowd or be a leader, take your pick\nNow I'm smokin' buddha Philly blunt style\nA frustrated and confused young juvenile\nSingin' the project blues, so I choose\nTo take a piece of the action\nBut my sober state of mind won't let it happen\nThe 24/7 is the number one stresser\nDealin' with the peer pressure\n\n\nMost don't understand how it is in the world of today\nGrowin' up as a young black teen\nI used to dream, of bein' a architect\nEasier said than done, believe me, it's hard to get\nOutta the projects, without forgettin' where you came from\nMy parents told me from day one:\nFinish school and avoid all obstacles\nBut my environment makes it so impossible\nFor instance, build a strong social life\nWithout messin' up, still tryin' to live right\nLike in junior high, I used to wonder why\nCertain females went out with certain guys\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nThen one day, it all dawned on me, yo\nYou gotta be down, and have it goin' on, see?\nI wasn't down with the mainstream, or should I say their team?\nHa! Now I'm gettin' steamed\nGotta find a way to get accepted by my peers\nSo now I'm sippin' on beers\nBuyin' new gear, nuthin' but the best\nForget Levi's, strictly Polo and Guess\nBut how would I make the cash?\nIt gotta be easy and it gotta be fast\nThinkin' to myself \"Does that make me lesser?\"\nJust, dealin' with the peer pressure\n\n\nAround my way, there's a kid that most don't understand\nHow he lives; is it negative or positive?\nHe has a grade A average\nBut when he's on the streets with his friends, he's a savage\nA freshman of high school, daily attendant\nHe never got in trouble, never did he get suspended\nGood little Kenny, who would believe?\nHe dropped out of school to start to smoke weed\nI saw the signs, but I didn't pay attention\nBecause he got offended every time that I would mention\nThe drinkin', the smokin', the low school grades\nAnd sleepin' in class, laid back with his black shades\nNowadays, you catch Kenny hangin' in the hallways\nWith his crew, findin' more ways\nTo break outta school, and hit the block and get buckwild\nStay out of the way of a mad child\n'Cause he's a product of hell\nKenny never fell, but he's gonna fall overall\nSo let's take a trip to the ghetto\nWhere Kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man, so\nHe pulled the trigger and the suicide note read:\n\"I'm glad it's finally over and I'm finally dead\nAnd no more do I have to feel lesser\nOr deal with the peer pressure\"\n4Embed"

Willin' to die in Revolutionary War, dunn\nBoom! goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray\nHow can we keep leading if the people keep retreating?\nNah, boom! goes the cannon, push forward, no fear\nWe gon' win this war and run them clowns outta here\nBoom! goes the cannon, watch they bodies and guns drop\nNow we the real leaders, opposition retreats when\nBoom! goes the cannon, push forward, no fear\nWe gon' take the war and run them outta hereEmbed"

(What's the resolutions?)\n\nWealth, health, and happiness nigga\nWill Keep me from runnin' 'round clappin' these niggas\nSometimes you gotta just handle your business\nFuck it, it's on me, rounds of shots for niggas\nPunk, I wake up everyday to cathedral ceilings\nJumpin' out my bed, wall to wall marble and pillars\nLivin' like the pharaoah Tut, I'm blessed with life\nSo I breathe deep and give praise to the most high\nThen I, get fresh for a new day\nI eat broccoli for breakfast and smoke my trees\nTurn on the flat screen to C-Span, see the elite strength\nAttorney general slowly gettin' bills passed\nProphecies comin' to pass\nWe gotta survive this shit dunn, it's nothin' to laugh at (For real)\nI hops in the V, grab the heat and I stash that\nI'm in tune with Doc, Pac, and Huey, it's a rap\n\nI traveled the world, and been alot of places\nBelieve me dog, ain't nothin' like home\nAnd if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself\nYou got drama, who's gonna clap that chrome?\nNobody like you, somebody like me\nWhen death, I'm ready for it in Threes\nAnd me off point?

C'mon now nigga please\nI'm paranoid, you know I'm burnin' those trees\nI kiss my finger, cross my heart, I'mma make it out these dark days\nWhether together or we part ways\nI got a promise to that boy tatted on my arm\nThree strong, man, the heat's still lukewarm\nWho can you trust when your friends wanna pop your safe?\nYou let him stash in your place, now you watch his waist\nVision the days, hear the ghost whisper\nDogs we left in the past, brought back now here with us\nCross my heart, let the haze linger\nPour out a little liquor, knowin' God took a good nigga\nThousand dollar slippers skirt from the scene he was just a worker\nDawg, you was his every dream\nI kissed his face like I never knew 'em\nIt was me, once upon a time when life was ruined\nNow the mink rope chain sparklin', jumpin' out of bed\nThousand dollar slippers slidin' huggin' the carpets\n\nI traveled the world, and been alot of places\nBelieve me dog, ain't nothin' like home\nAnd if you want somethin' done, you gotta do it yourself\nYou got drama, who's gonna clap that chrome?\nNobody like you, somebody like me\nWhen death, I'm ready for it in Threes\nAnd me off point?

Bitch-ass nigga\n\nNah, you don't want none\nBitch-ass nigga\nNah, you don't want none\nBitch-ass nigga\nNah, you don't want none\nBitch-ass nigga\nNah, you don't want none\nBitch-ass\n\nKick it when I'm wicked and all smoked out\nThe little nigga that gets on your nerves so read about\nYou say your shorty's trauma, what's all the drama?\nI shoot 'em up like their last name is Farmer\nShorty got the death wish, I wish to die\nBut when I try, it just goes by\nYou couldn't kill me because I can't kill myself\nAnd if I got beef, then I got it for self\nAnd if I catch a body, I catch it for self\nTo me, murder is good for the health\nLittle man paranoid, Mr. Schizophrenic\nThirty-five niggas wanna funk, don't panic\nJust shoot a head up, or take your beatin' like a man\nOr pull a burner if you want a longer lifespan\nThat's how I see it, if I gotta die, so be it\nBut maybe one day, my luck'll run out, though\nUntil then, I couldn't give a fuck, yo\nLittle shorty one time, I'm goin' all out for mines\n'Cause there won't be a next time\nSo what you wanna do, punk? Back up a little\nGimme some space, I'm hittin' hearts, street sweeper\nA little crazed nigga from the streets\nRaised in the ghetto, I'm puttin' out heads, yo\nI'm open, time to catch wreck, put 'em in check\nSnap his neck, grab his loot, then jet\nWho's next to be a victim? Easily ripped up\nGet ready to run when I ripped 'em\nDrop to the floor, feel the wrath of the drug war\nCall me a thug who gets buck when I want more\nManiac with a TEC-9\nHit me up now, 'cause there won't be a next time\nNah, you don't want none, bitch-ass nigga\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nNah, you don't want none\nBitch-ass nigga\nNah, you don't want none\nBitch-ass nigga\nNah, you don't want none\nBitch-ass nigga\nNah, you don't want none\nBitch-ass nigga\nNah, you don't want none\nBitch-ass\n\nWho's that nigga standin' with the jewels?\nThrow on my hood, cock back the tool\nJust to get a rep, yeah, you're god damn right\nJust lick, lick shots 'cause I don't fuck with fights\nBack on the ave when five-o arrive\nChalk on the ground where the motherfucker died\nNiggas know who did it, but ain't nobody snitchin'\nNo word of to myself, if they do, I'm flippin' the script\nSettin' it off, yo, put 'em in a dope fiend\nAnd cut 'em up like protein\nThe lord of criminal juvenile crimes committed\nSet it some bitch-ass nigga, I'm with it\nYou couldn't fuck with the skills of the five foot\nAnd all it takes is a set to get your crew shook\nThe fuck up, kid, your rap styles sucks\nI'm bustin' niggas like my first nut\nShould I pull the trigga?

how they never gonna change\nIt ain't a thing, niggas wild, then I'm cockin' that thing\nCuz you know with every action there's a reaction\nAnd there's no known cure when I'm sick with the clappin'\nHow many times it have to happen\nNiggas talkin' like they generals but just mere captains\nThe streets there's rules, slugs hit 'em with infractions\nAnd then there's Hollywood if you want some fuckin' acting\nYou got these niggas out mis-representin' they hood\nGive 'em heart now they icin', I'm like nigga what's good?\nCuz you know how I get with these MACs and these techs\nBlaze 'em down gives a fuck about the next nigga rep\nPlay around find yourself getting' cheated by death\nMan gone and believe me dog it happened to the best\nSee Mobb Deep LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like\nYou know a nigga, I be tryin' to chill\nBut now and then I hafta run these niggas a drill (no doubt)\nThere comes a time in every nigga life\nWhen he's face to face with that ol' kill

mean nothing, homes (what)\nMy gun is bustin'\nFuck all y'all niggas my stomach is touchin'\nAnd I be right there on Myrtle Ave, come through\nYou bitch ass niggas wouldn't know what to do\nI get bulletproof love, pounds and hugs\nYou get extorted by the thugs that gew up in your hood\nYou get killed fuckin' with P, you really should\nNot do that, I use that Ruger good\nCatch a bad one\nRan

I live by them shits\nY'all niggas not ready for this\nYou not knowin' how you about to get your head crushed\nSpray it dunn, straight out\nShitted when them guns come out\n\nYou know a nigga, I be
