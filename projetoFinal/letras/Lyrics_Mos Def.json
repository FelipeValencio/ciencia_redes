  "plain": "Yasiin Bey, (born Dante Terrell Smith) formerly known by his stage name Mos Def, is an actor and hip hop artist from Brooklyn, New York. He is one of the founding fathers of conscious hip hop and half of the duo Black Star. Beginning in 2012, he ditched his stage name Mos Def in favor of Yasiin Bey, saying:\n\nI began to fear that Mos Def was being treated as a product, not a person, so I\u2019ve been going by Yasiin since \u201899. At first it was just for friends and family, but now I\u2019m declaring it openly.\n\nHe made his musical debut in 1998 as a part of Black Star (see Mos Def & Talib Kweli are Black Star), and then released his first solo album in 1999, Black on Both Sides to widespread acclaim."

Where you came from?\nNeck and wrist laced up, very little make-up\nThe Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up\nIs sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?\nI tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down\nAsked her to dance and she was like, \"Yo, I'm leavin' now\"\nAn hour later, sounds from Jamaica\nShe's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up\nScene 2 \u2014 my fam's throwin' a jam\nFareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans\nThe brother Big Mu makes space for me to move\n\"A-yo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce\"\nI turned around (Say word!)\nYou was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed\nTryin' to play me for the herb (Yeah, that's her)\nShocked as hell she couldn't get it together\nI just played along and pretended I never met her\nHow you feelin'? \"Oh, I'm fine,\" my name is Mos, \"I'm Sharice\"\nI heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet\nWe moved to the booth reserved for crew especially\nAnd honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me\nI'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically\n'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry\nDesigner fabric, shoes and accessories\nChinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally\nWe conversated, made her laugh \u2014 yeah, you know me, bro\nEven though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo\nI'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family\nShe hop up like, \"How you gon' leave before you dance with me?\"\nYou might also like\nI know I can't afford to stop\nFor one moment, that it's too soon to forget\nI know I can't afford to stop\nFor one moment, that it's too soon to forget\n\nShe blew my whole head with that, duke, I was like, word?\nI played it low though\nI was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go\nNiggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)\nYo, honey was so blazin', she was just..\nYo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother, man\nShe was that ill, man\nShe take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me..\n\n\"Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right\nBut baby, you know what it's like, some brothers don't be comin' right\"\nI understand, I'm feelin' you\nBesides, \"Can I have a dance?\" ain't really that original\nWe laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades\nThey playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist\nHeatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer\nSong finished then she whispered, \"Honey, let's exchange numbers\"\nScene 3 \u2014 weeks of datin', late night conversation\nIn the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient\nShe touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent\nShe walked away smilin', singin' Gregory Isaacs\nLike, \"If I don't, if I don't have you\"\nShowin' me her tan line and her tattoo\nPlayin' Sade, Sweetest Taboo\nBurnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled\nMan, I smashed it like a Idaho potato\nShe call me at my J.O., \"Come now\", I can't say no\nGinseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk\nCockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up\nThree months \u2014 she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever\nSix months \u2014 I'm tellin' her I desperately need her\nNine months \u2014 flu-like symptoms when shorty not around\nI need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down\nMidnight, we hook up and go at it\nBurn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart, I got to have it\nShe tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage\nWake up the next mornin', she gone like it was magic\nAww, damn it! My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic\nMy 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress\nNext week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club\nWith some bangin' ass Asian playin' lay it down and lick me up\nWhat!?55Embed"

Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape\nNow let it fall, huh!\n\nMy restlessness is my nemesis\nIt's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page\nI write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days\nScrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature\nI mathematically add-minister, subtract the wack\nSelector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that\nAhaha, from the core to the perimeter black\nYou know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)\nFull-blooded, full throttle\nBreathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the hum\nYoung man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!\nNative son, speaking in the native tongue\nI got my eyes on tomorrow (There it is)\nWhile you still tryna find where it is\nI'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently\nShine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse\nEmbrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips\nUsed to speak the King's English\nBut caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis\nLong range from the base-line (swish)\nMove like an apparition, low to the ground with ammunition\n(Chi-chi-pow) Move from the gate, voice cued\nOn your tape, putting food on your plate\nMany crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)\nWe went from picking cotton\nTo chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping\nBlues people got the blue chip stock option\nInvisible man, got the whole world watching\n(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your map\nI'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop\nWhere you can either get paid or get shot\nWhen your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock\nWhen your chart position drop, then the phone calls....\nChill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot\nDon't gas yourself, akh'\nThe industry just a better built cell block\nA long way from the shell tops\nAnd the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)\nYou might also like\nThe more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock\n\nHip Hop is prosecution evidence\nAn out of court settlement, ad space for liquor\nSick without benefits (hungh!) Luxury tenements\nChoking the skyline, it's low life getting tree-top high\nIt is a back water remedy\nBitter and tender memory, a class E felony\nFacing the death penalty (hungh!)\nStimulant and sedative, original repetitive\nViolently competitive, a school unaccredited\nThe break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate\nHip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it\nMedicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy\nPropers to B-Boys getting busy\nThe war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot\nA two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot\nOlympic sponsor of the black Glock\nGold medalist in the back shot\nFrom the sovereign state of the have-nots\nWhere farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)\nIt's all-city like Phase 2\nHip Hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you\nDo whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you16Embed"

Oh\nShout out to all of my crew, East-West, North-South\nAll the continent, Europe, all abroad international\nBring it in, bring it in, bring it in, bring it in\nIt's a lot of things goin' on y'all\n21st century is comin'\n20th century almost done\nA lot of things have changed\nA lot of things have not, mainly us\nWe gon' get it together right? I believe that\nListen\u2014people be askin' me all the time\n\"Yo Mos, what's gettin' ready to happen with hip-hop?\"\n(Where do you think hip-hop is goin'?)\nI tell em, \"You know what's gonna happen with hip-hop?\nWhatever's happening with us\"\nIf we smoked out, hip-hop is gonna be smoked out\nIf we doin' alright, hip-hop is gonna be doin' alright\nPeople talk about hip-hop like it's some giant livin' in the hillside\nComin' down to visit the townspeople\nWe are hip-hop\nMe, you, everybody, we are hip-hop\nSo hip-hop is going where we going\nSo the next time you ask yourself where hip-hop is going\nAsk yourself: where am I going? How am I doing?\nTill you get a clear idea\nSo if hip-hop is about the people\nAnd the hip-hop won't get better until the people get better\nThen how do people get better? (Hmm)\nWell, from my understanding people get better\nWhen they start to understand that they are valuable\nAnd they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money\nOr 'cause somebody, think they sexy\nBut they valuable 'cause they been created by God\nAnd God makes you valuable\nAnd whether or not you recognize that value is one thing\nYou got a lot of societies and governments\nTryin' to be God, wishing that they were God\nThey wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere\nAnd make you think they got the all-seeing eye\nEh, I guess The Last Poets wasn't too far off\nWhen they said that certain people got a god complex\nI believe it's true\nI don't get phased out by none of that, none of that\nHelicopters, the TV screens, the newscasters, the satellite dishes\nThey just wishing\nThey can't really never do that\nWhen they tell me to fear they law\nWhen they tell me to try to have some fret in my heart behind the things that they do\nThis is what I think in my mind\nAnd this is what I say to them\nAnd this is what I'm saying to you check it\nYou might also like\nAll over the world hearts pound with the rhythm\nFear not of men because men must die\nMind over matter and soul before flesh\nAngels hold a pen, keep a record in time\nWhich is passing and running like a caravan trader\nThe world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked\nBut God is sufficient in disposing of affairs\nGunmen and stockholders try to merit my fear\nBut God is sufficient over plans they prepared\nMos Def in the flesh, where you at, right here\nOn this place called Earth, holding down my square\n\n'Bout to do it for y'all, and y'all at the fair\nSo just bounce, come on bounce\nB-b-bounce b-bounce b-bounce-bounce\nAnd just-\nJust step, two, three\nJust step, two, three, and\nStep two\nTwo, three and\nOne two three and four\nOne two three and four\nOnce again\nAll over the world hearts pound with the rhythm\nFear not of men because men must die\nMind over matter and soul before flesh\nAngels hold a pen, keep a record in time\nWhich is passing and running like a caravan trader\nThe world is overrun with the wealthy and the wicked\nBut God is sufficient in disposing of affairs\nGunmen and stockholders try to merit your fear\nBut God is sufficient over plans they prepared\nMos Def in the flesh, where you at, right here\nOn this place called Earth, holding down my square\n\nBout to represent in your whole atmosphere\nBout to represent in your whole atmosphere\nTo your atmosphere, to your atmosphere\nOh-ooh!\nThat was for you\u2014and Brooklyn, too!8Embed"

Bust it, yo!\nSometimes, I feel like I don't have a partner\nSometimes, I feel like my only friend\nIs the city I live in, this beautiful Brooklyn\nLong as I live here, believe I'm on fire, hey\n\n'Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K\nL-Y-N is the place where I stay\nThe B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K\nBest in the world and all USA\nIt's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K\nL-Y-N is the place where I stay\nThe B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K\nPlace where I rest is on my born day\n\nBust it!\nSometimes, I sit back and just reflect\nWatch the world go by, and my thought connect\nI think about the time past and the time to come\nReminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was spry and young\nI used to try and come to the neighborhood function\nThrow on my Izod, say a little somethin'\nWhen I was just a youngin', before the days of thuggin'\nHow me and Charlie Chims, and yo, what?! I'm only buggin'\nFast forward \u2014 9, now I gotta team my seed\nI must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed\nLivin' the now space and time, 'round the nine-to-five\nFor as long as I'm alive, pah, I gotta strive\nI ain't sittin roadside, that ain't part of the plan\nI'm out here for my fam', doin' all that I can\nI love my city! Sweet and gritty, inland to outskirts\nNickname Bucktown 'cause we prone to outburst\nPhilosophy redefine us, touch mine? I touch back\nWalk the streets like ya sweet, and get beat like drum tracks\nCatch no shakes, over Jakes (Woop-Woop!), we bust back\nBring the marty to your face with no place to run back\nI'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back\nThis ain't a game, clown, play ya James Brown and jump back\nWhat you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at\nDraw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at\nTryin' to hunt that, recurrin' dream of high stakes\nThe fourth largest, first hardest, Brooklyn is the place\nSettled by the Dutch many years ago\nThree million strong, and here we go!\nYou might also like\nGood morning, Vietnam!\n(We live in Brooklyn, baby) (Wake up, wake up)\n(We live in Brooklyn, baby) (Wake up, wake up)\n\nYo, sometimes, I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at\nUnlike any place I ever been at\nThe home of big gats, deep-dish hammer rim caps\nHave a mishap, push your wig back\nWhere you go to get the fresh trim at\nFulton and Jay got the Timb rack\nBlue collars metro cardin' it\nThugs mobbin' it, form partnership, increase armament\nStreet pharmacists \u2014 deep consequence\nWhen you seek sleek ornaments, you get caught\nRode the white horse and can't get off\nBig dogs that trick off just get sent off\nThey shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off\nIt's real, yo, but still, yo, it's love here\nAnd it's felt by anybody that come here\nOutta-towner's take the train, plane and bus here\nMust be somethin' that they really want here\nOne year as a resident, deeper sentiment\nThey shout out, \"Go Brooklyn!\" \u2014 they representin' it\nSittin' on they front stoop, sippin' Guinness's\nUsin' native dialect in they sentences\nFrom the tree-line blocks to the tenements\nTo the Mom and Pop local shop businesses\nWe travel all around the world in great distances\nAnd ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance\nThat's why we call it 'The Planet'\nNot a borough or a province, our style is uncommon\nFrom Sumner to Tompkins to Lafayette Gardens\nWyckoff, Gowanus, in they army jacket linings\nYo, this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle\nFriday night out in front The Himalaya, goin' wild\nThis goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village\nThe '90s, and all my yarda Trini Brownsvillers\nParkside tennis courts; 30's, 40's and the 50's\nThe cats out in Starrett City gettin' busy\nTo the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy\nBushwick and Canarsie\nFarragut, Fort Greene and Marcy\nMy Flatbush posse, generals and armies\nWhen it's time to form, just call me\nAnd let this song be playin' loud and long, B\nIf you love Bucktown strongly\nRaze it up!\nBrooklyn \u2014 my habitat, the place where it happen at\nLives sway in the sharp balance of the battle axe\nIrons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back\nIt's where you find the News Two crew cameras at\nIt's where my fam is at, the summertime jam is at\nThey play B.I.G. and get you open like a sandal back\nHotter than candle wax, hustlin', you can't relax\nThe crack babies tryin' to find where they mamas at\nIt's off the handle, black, with big police scandals that\nTurn into action screenplays sold to Miramax\nThe type of place where they check your appearance at\nAnd cats who know where all the hot 'Lo gear is at\nThe stompin' grounds where you find the pound smokers that\nBe Blazin' John, that have your wave cap floatin' back\nThe doorstep where the dispossessed posted at\nDope fiends out on Franklin Ave. sellin' Zovirax\nYou big ballin'? Better keep your money folded back\n'Cause once the young guns notice that, it's over, black!\n\"Brooklyn keep on takin' it!\" \u2014 worldwide we known for that!\nFlossy cats get it snatched like the local tax\nThe place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at\nWhere one of the greatest MC's was a local cat!14Embed"

We need it for the fire!\"\nYou might also like\nNew York is drinkin' it (New World Water)\nNow all of California is drinkin' it (New World Water)\nWay up North and Down South is drinkin' it (New World Water)\nUsed to have minerals and zinc in it (New World Water)\nNow they say it got lead and stink in it (New World Water)\nFluorocarbons and monoxide\nPush the water table lopside\nUsed to be free, now it cost you a fee\n'Cause oil tankers spill they load as they roam across the sea\n\nMan, you gotta cook with it, bathe and clean with it (That's right)\nWhen it's hot, summertime you fiend for it (Let 'em know)\nYou gotta put it in the iron you steamin' with (That's right)\nIt's what they dress wounds and treat diseases with (Shout it out)\nThe rich and poor, black and white got need for it (That's right)\nAnd everybody in the world can agree with this (Let 'em know)\nConsumption promotes health and easiness (That's right)\nGo too long without it on this earth and you leavin' it (Shout it out)\nAmericans wastin' it on some leisure shit (Say word?)\nAnother nation be desperately seekin' it (Let 'em know)\nBacteria washing up on they beaches (Say word?)\nDon't drink the water, son they can't wash they feet with it (Let 'em know)\nYoung babies in perpetual neediness (Say word?)\nEpidemics hoppin' up off the petri dish (Let 'em know)\nControl centers try to play it all secretive (Say word?)\nTo avoid public panic and freakiness (Let 'em know)\nThere are places where TB is common as TV\nCause foreign-based companies go and get greedy\nThe type of cats who pollute the whole shore line\nHave it purified, sell it for a dollar twenty-five\nNow the world is drinkin' it (New World Water)\nYour moms, wife, and baby girl is drinkin' it (New World Water)\nUp North and Down South is drinkin' it (New World Water)\nYou should just have to go to your sink for it (New World Water)\nThe cash registers is goin' \"cha-chink!\" for it (New World Water)\nFluorocarbons and monoxide\nGot the fish lookin' cockeyed\nUsed to be free, now it cost you a fee\n'Cause it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\n\nSaid it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\nSaid it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\nSaid it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\nSaid it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\nSaid it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\nSaid it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\nSaid it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\nSaid it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\nSaid it's all about gettin' that cash (Money)\nJohnny Cash (Money)\nRoseanne Cash (Money)\nGive me cash (Money)\nCold cash (Money)\nCash rules everything around me\nMove!13Embed"

Little Maurice in the sixth grade\nNo mama, no father, role model the dope game, say\nPoor so hard, bitch behave, standing behind the deuce-deuce-trey\nIce-cold, heat blow, closed casket, cold case\n\nPoor so hard, that shit cray\n\nThese young bloods is looking scary at the mall\nThey wearing pants, you can still see they drawers\nThey rob a nigga in the bathroom stall\nThey took his life cause he ain't want to take it off\nPoor so hard, that shit cray, ain't it, Bey?

Peace to all, fear none, this is Yasiin Bey. At this present time, I am currently in Cape Town, South Africa, and I'm being prevented from leaving, unjustly, unlawfully, and without any logical reason. They're saying that they want to deport my family. Uh, they're making false claims against me, some of these government officials, even in the press are making false claims against me, saying that my travel document that I was traveling with is fictitious, which it is not. Anyone can do the research about the world passport; it's not a fictitious document. It is not meant to deceive or derive unlawful benefit from any nation's state, at all. In fact, the world passport has been accepted here on numerous occasions in South Africa, in ports Johannesburg and Cape Town as early as 1996 and as late as 2015. You can see the stamps; they're there at the World Service Authority for anyone to investigate. To quote Lil Durk, I am not a liar. I've made no false claims. I have not misrepresented myself. I'm under unnecessary state supervision and scrutiny, and I have reason to believe or suspect that there are political motivations behind the way I'm being treated, because this is following no reasonable train of logic, as also, um...It's curious. I haven't broken any law, and I'm being treated like a criminal. I know I'm not unique in that regard, and I am grateful that I'm here with my family. I haven't been physically harmed or anything like that. However, I have been detained. People in this state have taken punitive action against me, unnecessarily. There's no reason I have to spend any time in the cell. There's no reason I had to have police come to my house, damn near six days later for something that happened at the airport, where nobody arrested me, and none of that ever happened, at all. This is not an administration of justice, and all I seek is to leave the state. I'm not looking to state any future claims against them for damages and none of that. People keep whatever little state jobs that they worried about or concerned about losing, because I'm not- I just wanna go home, and I don't live in America, and I have the right to domicile wherever I please, without fear or without interference\nThe state of South Africa has interfered with my ability to move or to even fulfill my professional obligations unnecessarily. And that's fine; we don't have to be enemies and we don't have to be friends either. My family and I are prepared, immediately, to make whatever move that we need to make outside of this state, never to return to this state again. We don't have to be here. We're not pining to be here, and we\u2019re complying in every possible way, reasonably. Just today, state officials visited my domicile asking questions about me and my family, and they had no right to do so. I have legal representation here who they could easily contact. They're contravening and breaking all types of international law, and it's untenable for me to just sit by and just let this go on. And I know it's been a lot of chatter about what's going on, you know, people are running to the press, because that's just\u2026you know, a money making machine. So, it\u2019s another exploitative measure to turn this into some soap opera, some tele-novella, and I have no interest in it. Furthermore, related but not directly related to this: I'm retiring from the music recording industry as it is currently assembled today, and also from Hollywood, effective immediately. I am releasing my final album this year. Um\u2026and that's that\nPeace to all, fear of none. Thank everyone for their time. Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite, as Nas said. And I'm on the side of the right, so people could wish however they want, but I ain't nobody's\u2026I ain't no threat or a hazard to nobody. I really try to mind my business. What people think about me is none of my business, and I'm not here to change people's opinions about me. You don't have to like me; you don't have to like everything that I say. The fact is, is that I have hurt no one. I have injured no parties, and all I require, as is my lawful right, is innocent passage to my domicile. That is all\nIn summary, I will say this, I will close with a simple prayer: To the one who has created the all, you know me better than I know myself, and I know myself better than people know me. So, forgive me for whatever they know or do not know. Make me better than whatever is said and do not make me responsible for whatever is said. Ameen, ameen, allahumma ameen\nAnd I'll close for you, Ye, with the, with the verse that I kicked for you on December 31st, when you was in Atlantic City and you announced that you and Kim were having Nori. And, and, shout out to Madlib, and Otis, and\u2026and\u2026and Michael and his entire family, and to Mama Jackson and to the whole Jackson clan in L.A., I wish you and your family the best, your mother, you know, reach out to me, Egon, you know, y'all know how to reach. Shout out to Corey Smyth, shout out to my brother Talib Kweli, salaam to my brother Kamaal Fareed, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, Islam, all of the Zulu Nation. The Zulu Nation real here; there's real Zulus. My brother, Siyabonga, the Madlalas. All of the people here who have supported me: this is no reflection on you. I love the people of this country. I love this continent. I do not have to sit idly by and just be persecuted unfairly by a state. They waste enough of my time and... I'm through with you Felicia... we're through. I don't want nothing from you. You can keep the records, the sweatshirts, everything; it's no problem. But I'll end with this verse that I wanna put on \"No More Parties in LA,\" if you would kindly allow me, my dear brother Kanye. And shout out to K. Lamar, too; I see you, my dudeLonely America, crazy America\nLoud ass, country ass, cocaine America\nLethal America, carcinogen, asthma\nCarbonated smoke throughout your blood plasma\nLights and camera, action, surveillance\nHelicopters, teleprompters\nFlossy newscasters, rich, fool, bastards\nWar, migrant workers, cold murder, traffic\nWelcome to Los... stop right there\nBiggie got shot right here\nAngeles\nHollywood, hoes, handguns\nPeace to all, fear none. This is Bey. Love. One23Embed"

A valued place. A native habitat)\nWe all got to have, some place where we come from (A place where something is discovered, founded, developed, or promoted)\nThis place that we come from is called home (A source, a headquarters, a home base)\nAnd even though we may love, this place on the map (All correlating to a teams place of origin on or into the point of which something is directed to the center or the heart. ?)\nSaid it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at\n\nI come up in the street around some real wild brothers\nWith more than one name and more than one baby mother\nMore than one case, been on more than one run\nGot more than one enemy and more than one gun\nPartner, all that is left to want is more\nWhile them cats whose less privileged is just more raw\nLess space cause the projects laced with more flaws\nLess sleep cause the nights ain't peace, it's more war\nThe can is raw like thirsty, rainy season thunder claps\nOn the block with your old pop pleading number act\nTo the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at\nTo the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped\nWith the jungle cats, lions and tigers, leopards and cheetahs\nFor gazelle you get chased like a zebra, they blaze cheeba-cheeba\nAnd dominate the weaker on the street\nHungry bellies only love what they eat and it's hard to compete\nWhen they smilin with your heart in they teeth\nAnd the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath\nSon I been plenty places in my life and time\nAnd regardless where home is, son home is mine\nYou might also like\nWe all got to have (in this world) some place where we come from (travellin travellin travellin travellin)\nThis place that we come from is called home (so many places I go)\nWe set out on our travels, (in this world) we do the best we can  (travellin travellin)\nWe travel this big earth as we roam (roam roam roam)\nWe all got to have, some place that we come from (people all over the world)\nThis place that we come from is called home (got to have some place to call home)\nAnd even though we may love, this place on the map (place on the map)\nSaid it ain't where ya from, (ain't where you from) it's where ya at\n\nSome people live out in-New York City\nSome people live out in-Atlanta\nSome people got to live-Chicago\nSome people do live-Miami\nAll my people at-California\nAnd other people got to live-London\nAnd everybody got to live in the whole big world\nTogether just you and me\n\nWhen I think of home, my remembrance of my beginning\nLaundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen\nChillin in front my building with my brother and them\nSpending nights in Bushwick with my cousins and them\nWise town and Beat Street, federal relief\nSlowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat\nSticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep\nWith every flavor Now & Later only a dime apiece\nOld timers on the bench playing cards and thangs\nTelling tales about they used to be involved in things\nStart to drinking, talking loud, cussing up and showing out\nOn the phone, call the cops, pick'em up, move'em out\nAnd it's all too common to start wildin\nI'm a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence\nAnd it's hard to find\nBlock parties in dark lobbies\nFuneral homes packed but only dark bodies\nI can't sleep hardly, stirred up like Bob Marley\nMarley Marl played the symphony, remember we recall\nSon I been to many places in my space and time\nAnd whatever my home is, son home is mine\nWe all got to have, (been all over this world) some place where we come from (travellin travellin travellin travellin)\nThis place that we come from is called home (so many places I go)\nWe set out on our travels, (set out on the travels) we do the best we can (and do the best I can)\nWe travel this big earth as we roam (? best I know)\nWe all got to have, (we all got to have) some place where we come from (some place you call home)\nThis place that we come from is called home (some place your heart can be close to)\nAnd even though we may love, (we may love) this place on the map (this place on the map)\nSaid it ain't where ya from, (no no) it's where ya at (it ain't where ya at)\nI said it ain't where ya from, (hey hey) it's where ya at\nI said it ain't where ya from, (no no) it's where ya at\n(I said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at)\n(I said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at)\n(I said it ain't where ya from, it's where ya at)\nIt's where ya at6Embed"

Now put your minds on that\nGet real or get back, quit frontin, face facts\nThe old-timers say we're living in the final days\nGun smoke, young folks living any kind of way\nGangster holiday, greedy snakes and hideaways\nMeanwhile soldiers take it straight through their armor plates\nCrash hit the market gates, marvels of the modern age\nAccess is instant and treachery is commonplace\nI sense the dangers and I'm not afraid\nBecause when all is said and done there's only ONE\nMan up playboy, playing the game boy\nPull back, spectacular aim boy\nSay what you say boy, whoever could make noise\nAnd ride range off in the same voice\nConduct an arrangement with definite language\nIt's pure inspiration for this generation\nSpeak true free love\nBecause when all is said and done there's only one\nAnd the one cyaa done so cool\nSchooling the young like Rev. Run (\"whose house?\")\nQuote Pac and tell 'em keep their heads up\nAnd when the pressure comes down press back and press up\nFret not ghetto world, guess what?\nGod is on your side the devil is a lie (alive?)\nThe Empire holds all the gold and the guns\nBut when all is said and done there's only...\n(La ilaha ill'Allah)\nB.O.O.G.I.E.M.A.NYou might also like1Embed"

Look alive, breathe..wooh!\nHa! How it goes...\n\nMother, mother...\nHead in her hands\nHer first born son dead in her hands\nThe whole thing was a setup, a scam\nThey knew it was set up and planned\nNiggas he worked with wet him and ran, and that's..\nBrother, Brother...\nBut son, I don't see no brother hood\nAll I see is thugger hood\nGet rich and fuck the hood\nAll they want is some good smoke from the hood\nLookin for the shorty good stroke from the hood\nThat's how they touch the hood\nBut when I touch the hood, I'll make it brighter, black\nBecause I'm brighter, black\nAnd I'm so black I'm bright, shine through the blackest night\nShine when I'm live, shine via satellite\nShout in the hood, we get the picture\nCuz everytime you out in the hood, you got photographers witcha\nWhat's going on? Ha!\nUnderstand this is real life...\nThis how it goes on, this how it goes on...\nIt keep going on, this how it goes on...\nGhetto people look alive, get free\nGet involved, remain to breathe...Ha! Wooh!\n\nIf Marvin was alive now, wow... what would I say to him?\nWhere could I start? How could I explain to him??\nI know the minor world would probably look strange to him\nWould he feel like today had a place for him?\nGlobal imprisonment, sickness, indifference\nWhen he said, \"Save the babies,\" was we listenin?\nWhen he said, \"Mercy, mercy,\" did he really know..\nThat decades later we'd still be killin folks?\nOr did he hope that we would realize..\nThat we the first, the son of earth..\nThe moon and stars, the great beyond..\nWe black and proud, we brave and strong..\nWe raise it up, we quiet storm, forever fresh..\nAnd keepin on..?\n\nHa! Ghetto people look alive and free, ya get real\nThis how it goes on, and you say you say\nThis how it goes on, and you say you say\nThis how it goes on\nGhetto people look alive and free and breathe! Ha!\n\nHold the beat! Stop the beat! Drop the beat!\nHold the beat! Stop the beat! Drop the beat!\nHold the beat! Stop the beat! Drop the beat!\nHold the beat! Stop the beat! Got the beat!\n\nThere ain't nothin to be afraid of..\nGhetto people look alive and free, ya get real...\nThis how it goes on\nThis how it goes on, keep goin on..\nThis how it goes on\nNow breathe!\nMarvelous, marvelous, marvelous Marvin\nModern Marvel...Embed"

Louisana jug wine and conk out\nThrow her hands high and make her backside pop out\nWatch out! If you don't have the V.I.P. lacq' out\nThem big dollars they talk 'bout, just turn around and walk out\nYou better watch out! Exotic fabrics, speech in larynx\nThink it's mid-day traffic, runnin' game like the Mavericks\nMakin time seem elastic when we stretch out and smash it\nThen vanish like a phantom and hurt my understandin', like what?\nSpecial, special dedication\nTo all the fine-ass ghetto troublemakers, out in the world today\nSome in this very party right here right now tonight\nSome of them listenin' to this song in they jeeps\nSome of them listenin' to this song at they job\nSome of them runnin' game on some cat right now\nI want you to just rock and bounce to that\nRock and bounce to that\n\nI say girls, girls, girls, girls\nReach out and clap your hands\nI be the fabulous man so, just play the fabulous fan\nAnd, bring the breeze, bring the breeze\nSay girls, girls, girls, girls\nReach out and clap your hands\nI be the fabulous man so, just play the fabulous fan\nAnd, bring the breeze, bring the breezeEmbed"

Did our love have to die? You and I were so fucking fly\nCan't get it off my mind\nThe things that made me smile now make me cry\nYou might also like\nYou are the one\nYou're the one! Fuck you!\n\nI wish we never met, I wish we never kissed\nI wish we never touched (Swear to God)\nI wish I didn't love you so much\nI wish I could forget how feel, how you f..\nThat's a lie, the shit that made me smile, now make me cry\n\nYou are the one\nYou're the one! Fuck you!\n\nSometime I wish we'd come back\nMan, I wish we'd come back (Memories!)\nNo lie, for real? Fuck that\nNo, for real\nIt's a dangerous necessity\nIt's a world famous mystery, love\nThat's it, peace!2Embed"

Fake Bonanza!\nYou might also like\nGladiator, circus world\nGlamour, pussy, pimp, whole good and service world\nParanoid, itchy-trigger-nigga nervous world\nShaytanic natural order in reversal world\nThe ipod, no God, zero circle world\nThe blow-a turtle world, smoke from the purple world\nThe killer murder world, hamburger murder world\nOpen twenty-four hours, all about them dollars\nPretty poison in pork sausage\nCold coffee and more coffins\nFake bonanza, fake bonanza\nHuh? What? I don't understand ya!\nWhat they talking bout save they soul, ohh lord, save they soul!\nHelp them reach the goal, peace!\nYou know, peace (boogieman!)\nDon't be scared\nOhh lord, save they soul\nOhh lord, save they soul\nOhh lord, save my soul!\nOhh lord, save my soul! Please\nMash'allah, kna mean\nBoogieman!\n\nWoke up this morning with my, my state on freedom and said I\nHad the baddest feeling, maybe you stayed on my mind, said I\nWoke up this morning with my, my state on freedom and said I\nHad the baddest feeling, maybe you stayed on my mind, said I\nWoke up this morning in my, my state, I'm dreaming\nAin't nothing even\nDreaming, praying, keeping\nWoke up this morning and my mind stayed on freedom\nWoke up this demon that keep staying on my mind\nSaid, woke up this morning and my mind stayed on freedom\nIt makes no difference what people say, ahhhhhhEmbed"

(Funk Crush)\nYoungblood just hungry\nIt's no glamour, it's no glory\nIt's no joke, no game\nIt's murder every day, murder (Boogeyman)\n(They shot the boy)\n\nThe murder of a teenage life\nFire from the cold steel, the heat from the brights\nThe temperature of flesh and the shortness of breath\nThe murder of a teenage threat\nThe aroma of sinsemilia dollar superstar\nScum of Vicodin cocaine tobacco leaf\nEcstatic tap-less fire water and freaky-deeky-e\nThe murder of a teenage chief\nMy easy speaking is easy as it seem to be\nHungry belly drama busts off easily\nBalloon bang, pop, hot as a bang spot in Bangkok\nColder than a pimp, cock, aim shot, the frame drop\nPressure pushed him to the earth like a rain drop\nTake not life in vain, now how the preacher was saying\nRemember anyway they laid him in the straight box\nDark suit and gray socks, the neighborhood is all distraught\nCandlelights upon the news report the families and students saw\nConfused in awe, they weep into each others' arms\n(It's murder) New absence from a mother's arms\nEven the warmth from the mother's arms\nCould not keep her son from harm\nFrom standing where the gun was drawn\nOvercome done and done he gone (Murder)\nShow a shell like a bell that rung\nThe blood burst, body temperature fell and plunged\nAnd in the time it took the medics to come\nThe breath eased out of his lungs\nAnd his soul eased out of the slums\nAnd the voice eased out of the drums\nThe sireens they gleam they swung (Murder)\nTelephone wire sneakers hung (Murder)\nFor the black and young, murder, and the Ave they from\nI am from the block the president did not campaign on\nWhere the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on\nWhere hustlers stretch the yay long\nHustle hard for an outpost to trade on\nFlip it over and make more\nWhere the blocks are yellow taped off\nYoungbloods is drained off for old beefs to graze on\nWhere the pressure just stay on\nBut the lights and the heat don't\nThe place that you witness the true power of street folks\nAnd that's where I'm coming from, people\nHigh-post, low-key eighth, OZ, a kilo\nLaw man, dope man, adversary, amigo\nPreacher man, pimp hand, both folding their C-notes\nA Black fist clutching deliverance for the people\nYoung hand reach out, strong hand reach in\nChop the devil hand and make the fucker stop reaching\nGhetto people know it when the voice of truth speaking\nM. Def, him for real, hold still, nigga, see it\nI ain't got to say please, just believe it\nThe unerasable, the black ink fact\nY'all fuckers know exactly how to act, get back\nForever Black (Forever Black), never wack (Never that)\nFrom the K (Killa K), that's that (That's that)\nSo you can kill all the yap\nBlap, blap, blap, blap, murder\nYou might also like\nThey shot the boy (Murder)\nThey shot the boy (Murder)\nThey shot the boy (Murder)\nThey kill 'em all1Embed"

   "lyrics": "8 ContributorsAn Open Letter From Mos Def LyricsAn Open Letter From Mos Def\nBy Mos Def\nFebruary 1999\nAn Open letter From Mos Def...\nDiallo was a West African immigrant with no prior criminal record who was shot and killed by police in the dark of night for simply being black. He was unarmed and shot at 41 times! No unarmed man should be shot at even once! One of the police officers involved in the Diallo shooting was involved in the killing of Patrick Bailey no more than a year and a half ago! Tyesha Miller was shot in her car in Los Angeles while she had a seizure! I could go on and on with the names of black people who have been killed at the hands of police just this year. But the list is so long that it would turn this letter into a statistic sheet.\nMost of the people that got killed by police this year and in the past have probably been some of your fans; fans of some of your favorite artists. They are black people who love us, who defend us, who protect us, who put us in our comfortable homes an dour luxury sports utility vehicles and our well kept hotels suites and our oversized tour buses. They're the people that buy our records, our t-shirts, our concert tickets, and so on, and so forth. They're the same people that are getting murdered, harassed, maimed, and beaten in streets all over the world everyday!\nThe only people in our community who have not responded to this incident are us. Hip-Hop made one hundred billion dollars last year!... A lot of those dollars came from the 'Comptoms', the 'Brooklyns', the 'Crown Heights', the 'Chicagos', the Detroit ghettos, the St. Louis ghettos... the same ghettos where police run around literally hunting black folks to murder... then cruise the streets shortly thereafter with impunity and arrogance.\nWe are the Senators and the Congressmen of our communities. We come from communities that don't have nobody to speak for them. That's why they love us. Because we talk about what nobody else will talk about. We represent them. And they need to know that we really represent them. Not when it's just a romantic notion or a paycheck attached to it. When something happens to them it matters to us, because when something happens to them it's happening to us. Because Amadou Diallo is your brother, your cousin, your man... Tyesha Miller is your sister, your aunt, your girl, your wife, your daughter... All of these people are you! You are no different! And just because we're at the top of the Billboard charts, seen on MTV daily, livin' comfortably doesn't mean that we can't get shot, we can't be harassed, we can't be maimed and mistreated.\nI hope this is as important to you as it is to me cause when I pass by the projects and when I pass by the hood I don't see nobody but me. I see everybody who looks like me. I see me many years ago as I'm sure many of you do. So it's time for us to come together from the 'jiggy' to the 'hardcore'; from the 'backpacker' to the man with the Lexus and really unite and show the world that we got strength. Show the world who we are. Represent who we are. Who we really are and where we really come from. Let's show people where our heart is... that we haven't forgotten.\nNow I'm askin' you and anybody who looks on this letter to come forward and show your heart, to show your love, to love the people who love you back by speaking out against the injustices that they suffer. Because believe me, if the clock was turned backwards we'd be those same people.\nPlease stay mindful of this. Please be considerate of this letter. Pass it around! Talk about this! Think about it! Keep it on your mind because if you don't... it's going to keep its mind on you.\nI wanna thank everybody for taking time out to read this letter. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time. All of the contact information and other information you need to know is enclosed.\nI want to wish everybody, each and everyone of ya'll peace, prosperity and love.\nPeace,\nMos DefEmbed"

Just a blessing. You know I got a place in Paris, I been out here several days over the past year, so, yea this is a heavy one. Let me say this too though man, none of this stuff is separated. Everything from Tamir Rice, to the Paris shooting, to what\u2019s happening to the students in University of Missouri, to what\u2019s happening in Wits (University) to what I been experiencing in the negative in South Africa, is all connected, it\u2019s all the same thing. It\u2019s just these forces, right, that are looking to just turn the world into a brutal place and to turn people into machines. And it\u2019s two things man that I want you to spread out. And I\u2019m not on Twitter, I\u2019m not on Instagram or none of that stuff and I appreciate people like you who are using their platform for some good things. But I need everybody, I need anybody, anybody with a Twitter account, Facebook, whatever. This is the time to be talking about the dignity and nobility of being a human being. Not a machine, not a puppet of the state. Of your own desires. For the sanctity and divinity and nobility of being a human being because this is what\u2019s really at stake. They trying to turn us into machines or just high functioning mammals, animals, beasts in a jungle that they create, the state, the politicians, the so-called doers of good, who claim to have the interests of the planet at heart and it\u2019s a lie and it\u2019s proven itself to be more and more of a lie every day. Right? People do all of this stuff to the state but the state hates the people. It is suspicious of people and it\u2019s only there to use people for their benefit. It made people shadows and husks of themselves. This is what these Paris attacks are about. And by the way, a big giant Fuck Off to ISIS. You don\u2019t represent nothing about Islam or nothing about the Prophet. And another giant Fuck Off to everybody who trying to say geez, this is Islam\u2019s fault. Islam ain\u2019t got nothing to do with colonialism or White power or none of that. And neither do Christianity or none of that stuff. People try to use these beautiful faiths to justify the nonsense and bullshit and just as much as charlatans and posers and mall rats walking around with skateboards. You lying. You don\u2019t represent nothing, you represent yourself. You represent bloodlust. You\u2019ve been paid and bought for by people who wanna turn this God's gift, this spaceship Earth into a hell and cell. You represent nobody, you ain\u2019t out here for the common good, you out here for you. Your small little narrow-minded, bigoted, dumb-ass beliefs. It has nothing to do with the greater good, you ain\u2019t helping nobody, you ain\u2019t for the Muslims, you ain\u2019t for nobody. You a hazard to everybody. Stop trying to claim us like you here for us, you\u2019re not. It's not what the Prophet was about,  the last words of the Quran \u201c Lakum D\u012bnukum Wa Liya D\u012bni \u0644\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u200c\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064f\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u200c\u0648\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064e \u200c\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0650 \u201d - \u201cto you be your way and to me be mine.\u201d\nI\u2019m not here to defend the sanctity of Islam. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about, we are human beings, we on a spaceship, we all on the same spaceship. We all here together man, I read these comments on this damn internet these comment pages man, people are treating each other so poorly bruh, people don\u2019t know how to disagree even man. That\u2019s the measure of a civilization brother, not how well you agree, but how well you can disagree. That\u2019s civilized. All of what we\u2019re leaving for our children, what examples are we leaving to our children man? Everybody need to read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Post it up. Put it on your Twitter. Everybody. And Charlie Chaplin\u2019s speech from The Great Dictator. We live by each other's happiness not each other's misery. And this is the misery bruh, that you just heaping and heaping upon the world.\nThe state kills the children, and says they justified in murdering children. They kill unarmed people and say that they justified in doing it. I mean everybody who\u2019s sad about Paris should be just as sad and angry about Tamir Rice. How all these young innocent people dying over nothing. Dying over somebodies greed, dying over their antiquated backwards ass beliefs that they aren\u2019t human. Cry for them. And leave comments for them. And make the UN acknowledge the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a law. Cause furthermore, with Hollande talking about closing the borders, how are you gonna put innocent people under suspicion for crimes that they didn\u2019t commit. Closing these borders does not bring back any of them dead people. Not one of them. And if it\u2019s all about prevention that\u2019s nonsense. I don\u2019t think Francois Hollande cares any more about the Parisian people than ISIS. I really really don\u2019t. Their response, as usual, is to throw more people into more panic, more frenzy, there\u2019s nothing, there\u2019s nothing wise about these types of responses. It\u2019s all meant to just get you into a reactionary phase and to start viewing your brothers and sisters, you human brothers and sisters with suspicion and hatred and judgment man. We have to loving and caring about one another because guess what if we did, this shit would not be going on. And we have trusted these people who say that they love us, and say that they\u2019re here for us in the names of the state and the government and democracy and the presidency and congress and everything else. We have trusted them so much. They are sickening us, they are destroying our world and they\u2019re destroying the future for our children and we cannot just idly stand by and get into these nonsense, bull-rally, exchange back and forth with each other just to prove how clever we are or to win a debate that don\u2019t change nothing of the conditions that we all experiencing. I don\u2019t care who you are or where you are, white, black, rich, poor, Jew, Gentile, you are feeling it on this planet Earth today. And mind you, the people planning this knew exactly what they were doing. It was a new moon this week, ok, they trying to put some poison onto this one, they trying to set their intentions to turn this world into a cell with everything that they doing. And they got all of us scrambling around arguing on the left, arguing on the right, are you conservative, are you a liberal, it\u2019s nonsense. You know what, it\u2019s like Dave Chappelle said, when they asked him they said who gon\u2019 win between Pacquiao and Mayweather, he said \u201cthe promoters\u201d. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. They promote this conflict everywhere. It\u2019s the Muslims versus the Christians, it\u2019s the heterosexuals versus the homosexuals, it\u2019s the women versus man, it\u2019s youth versus the elders, it\u2019s man versus nature. It\u2019s always a fight, there\u2019s always somebody or some small group that make money no matter what the outcome is and they promote conflict, they don\u2019t promote harmony. They don\u2019t promote peace, they say that, but my grandmother said they say \u201cpeace, peace, peace\u201d but they really got evil wicked intentions in their heart. They want to control people, they want to control what you think how you think what you say, where you say, who you say it to. Read that Universal Declaration of Human Rights, read it. Post it up. People need to see it and see how the majority of governments in this world are breaking every part of that agreement. People say oh, it\u2019s just something to be written down. Well if that\u2019s the standard, that\u2019s supposed to be the benchmark for how we\u2019re supposed to behave as a civilization and how states are supposed to behave with their members, then they have failed. They are failing and they are actually committing illegal acts. If you don\u2019t have enough knowledge of the law, they need to learn the law, they need to learn what the real law is, what its national law is, they need to stand up for the rights cause they taking all of our power away from us and using it against us to destroy us\nFS: I see that, I see that. I was most frustrated at the fact that we\u2019ve seen this over and over and over. Certain things are deemed \u2018terrorism\u2019 and it\u2019s the worst thing in the world and people have dependents and they light candles around the world, and all of this when we been marching and crying\u2026\nYB: Light a candle for Tamir Rice. Light a candle for Tamir Rice. He was born June 25 2002. He was 12 years old. If you got -- come on man\nFS: It keeps happening. We do need the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But I fear that it\u2019s not us, you and I, our group who we get along, who we see eye to eye with, we\u2019re not the ones --\nYB: I ain\u2019t saying nobody, fuck them all man. Psalms 34 verse 4 \u201cI asked the Lord to deliver me and He delivered me through all my fears.\u201d He delivered me from my fears. What are we afraid of? What are we afraid of? You know I\u2019m really more afraid of living in a world that they are proposing for us through these types of actions, but for my sons and my daughters have to live in a world where they got to negotiate a relationships with these beasts disguised as human beings. And if you gonna be outraged about what they did at the Bataclan, by the way people can shut the fuck up, I live in Paris, I performed at the Bataclan. One of my dear friends lost somebody, I dunno who I lost, I dunno who I lost in that.\nFS: I feel you bro\nYB: I wish my French was better, I would speak directly in French to the French people. Listen man, don\u2019t be hustled human beings, don\u2019t be hustled. Don\u2019t let them make you think that they care about you. Yea, Obama was right, this is an attack against humanity. And so it is when Tamir Rice gets shot by the police and the state say that it was justified. So is everything that\u2019s happening at the University of Missouri. So is Japan not telling the world the truth about Fukushima, that\u2019s tyranny too. So is everybody else acting like Fukushima is not a problem for the Earth, like all of the oceans ain\u2019t connected, like that radioactive dust ain\u2019t showing up on the shores of Canada right now, like it\u2019s not showing up on the shores of California beaches, like it ain\u2019t two-headed babies out here. Tyranny is tyranny, period. Tyranny is tyranny. If we\u2019re gonna be against tyranny, we gotta be against it wherever it\u2019s at. It makes me think of that saying that my dad used to say to me, that \u201cthe government is tough on crime cause they don\u2019t like competition.\u201d Ok, now it\u2019s some bullshit when somebody else is not licensed, like James Bond, or some shit, go ahead and kill somebody. But when they got on a uniform, it\u2019s cool. Which stands to the sick-minded people of the world, oh, if I wanna kill, I need to go get out here and get registered and licensed to kill. So I get me a uniform or one of these state appendages whether it be the police or the military and I subvert all of these murder impulses into that I'll just aim it at whatever or whoever they tell me to aim it at. Cause I was waiting for an excuse to kill somebody anyway. And what do they expect? What type of society are you tryna build -- it is the trickle down theory, they state run around killin\u2019 people so the people like murder must be alright. I\u2019m not justifying that but that\u2019s what happening. You understand what I\u2019m saying? Who is more violent than the state against humanity? People feel it when it\u2019s a couple hundred people because you look at and see, but nobody feel it when it\u2019s half a million Iraqi kids that die from sanctions, or when it\u2019s people going through hell in Palestine. But it\u2019s at more of a premium when it\u2019s people in a smaller group just out tryna enjoy Friday night, then you feel it? Or when it happen to you because them kids in Palestine they not you. And that\u2019s their own fault. See, they showing even the media response, and don\u2019t trust the media neither, cause they\u2019re not there to give you the truth and make you feel balanced, or to tell you the facts. They want you to feel nervous so that you will trust the state more so that they will endorse and gratify their power and ream control over your life and ultimately you could end up feeling nervous and your cathartic response is to go to the arcade, the mall, the titty club, wherever to offload some of that, to offload that negative feeling. You wanna keep this stored up? This is a raving bonanza for all these quote-unquote \u201cnews media people\u201d they know all these peoples\u2019 eyes is glued to the screen, they in shock, they in awe, they hurt. Like I\u2019m hurt right now and in the interim they\u2019re gon\u2019 try to sell you every widget and gadget and every other useless damn thing that you can imagine cause they got you, you captive. It\u2019s an old axiom in the news, if it bleeds, it leads. So what they gotta do, they gotta make sure that people stay bleeding. But see, Psalms 34 verse 4 \u201cI ask the Lord to deliver me, He delivered me from all my fears.\u201d And this quote is saying in the Quran too, \u201cwe will not change the conditions of a people until they change what is in themselves.\u201d You are not gonna get a better world hating your fellow man. You can hate the conditions, but you have to love your brother and as corny as it sounds, as clever as niggas are, as edgy as they wanna be, got a chip on their shoulder cause it\u2019s fashionable, you know, that\u2019s in style, it\u2019s very involved to be melancholy and moody and edgy and curmudgeonly. The love man, love must and will prevail. I don\u2019t care how corny it sounds. I ain\u2019t tryna win no swag wars, who cares man. The world is in, has been in a state of emergency. And I hope that these types of things make people wake up, man we keep treating each other like this man If you just get rid of them, they just gonna be gone. The problem is not Islam, the problem ain\u2019t organised patriarchy. The problem is all of these things that have dysfunction to them or people who dysfunction within them, these systems, right. The problem is peoples\u2019 lack of compassion and care for themselves and for their fellow human beings and that\u2019s what keeps all of this nonsense going. We don\u2019t treat each other well. We need to treat each other better than what we\u2019re doing. And we need to stop giving our allegiance to people who are mistreating us. And the government, particularly the US government, many of the Western governments, they are mistreating their own citizens and people around the world. They have a long legacy of this and it has to stop. It\u2019s illegal to deny access to this planet Earth to anybody, we are all on this spaceship. I don\u2019t wanna hear a muthafucking \u2018nother thing about Mars. We don\u2019t deserve Mars if we can\u2019t do right by Earth. We don\u2019t deserve it. Shut the fuck up about Mars and do right by Earth, you won\u2019t have to fucking go to Mars. By the way, we\u2019re already in outer space with your clever asses, we\u2019re already here. On this spaceship Earth. The planet\u2019s spinning all the time, everything we need is here. I don\u2019t wanna hear nothing about colonising or nothing else. No more fucking colonial fictions and fantasies. Earth is sufficient. But if we don\u2019t do right by each other, we gon\u2019 eliminate ourselves the trees, the oceans, I don\u2019t give a fat baby\u2019s ass. Things will continue to go on as they did. We will eliminate ourselves. Please, don\u2019t make Bill Gates right. \u201cWe need to thin out the herd\u201d. You got fucking radioactive Fukushima over here, police running crazy, I was walking around in Paris, I was like why all these people wanna see a motherfucking AK-47 and all that shit, that don\u2019t make me feel secure. They trying to drive people into a state of high stress so people don\u2019t have the space to really slow it down, love themselves and love one another and work their problems out for themselves because guess what, we got the answers within us. Why it\u2019s these ugly knuckleheads with ties and lifelong pensions representing the people who don\u2019t represent the people. You represent yourself, you represent the banks, you represent the corporations, you represent the nigga that keeps the tanks running around the world crushing people and taking resources out of the Earth. Talking about we making the world safer, you destroying the world. The world that we all gotta share. And they so dumb, that they think the can build some high fence where they can dominate the world from a striking safe distance and they won\u2019t be in misery. Let me tell you what my grandfather used to tell me. He\u2019d tell all us that to keep a man in the hole, you gotta get in that hole with him. Some part of you is in that hole. If you trying to keep him in that hole, some part of your mind and your spirit is right there in that hole with him. Whoever you digging a hole for, you really digging it for yourself.1Embed"
