  "plain": "Considered by many to be one of the greatest rappers of all time, The Notorious B.I.G. was a major figure in both hardcore hip-hop and \u201890s pop music until his murder in 1997 at age 24. He\u2019s best known for his #1 hits \u201cHypnotize\u201d and \u201cMo\u2019 Money, Mo\u2019 Problems,\u201d his Top 10 hits \u201cOne More Chance (Stay with Me Remix)\u201d and \u201cBig Poppa,\u201d and his iconic early single \u201cJuicy.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his crossover hits, Biggie is known for innovative multi-syllabic lyricism and creative storytelling techniques heard on critical favorites like \u201cWarning,\u201d \u201cSuicidal Thoughts,\u201d \u201cTen Crack Commandments,\u201d \u201cI Got A Story To Tell,\u201d and \u201cGimme The Loot.\u201d\n\nAs a teenager, Brooklyn native Christopher Wallace started rapping as Biggie Smalls, the name of a mobster character in the 1975 action comedy Let\u2019s Do It Again. He recorded a demo with local Bed-Stuy DJ 50 Grand, which caught the attention of Mister Cee, who was well-known as Big Daddy Kane\u2019s DJ. Mister Cee introduced his demo to the industry, landing him a spot in The Source\u2019s coveted \u201cUnsigned Hype\u201d column in the magazine\u2019s March 1992 issue. A rising star A&R at Uptown Records named Sean \u201cPuffy\u201d Combs heard the demo and got Biggie signed to the label.\n\nBiggie\u2019s first commercially released recording was an uncredited verse on Puffy\u2019s remix of Jamaican dancehall star Super Cat\u2019s 1992 track \u201cDolly My Baby.\u201d He followed it up with appearances on tracks by Uptown artists like Heavy D & The Boyz\u2019s posse cut \u201cA Buncha Niggas\u201d and Mary J. Blige\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s the 411 (Remix).\u201d His first solo single, 1993\u2019s \u201cParty & Bullshit,\u201d was produced by frequent collaborator Easy Mo Bee and appeared on Uptown\u2019s soundtrack for the comedy Who\u2019s The Man. The song was released under the name \u201cBig\u201d\u2014a Los Angeles rapper named \u201cBiggy Smallz\u201d was already signed to MCA Records, preventing Biggie from using his original name.\n\nIn mid-1993, Puffy left Uptown and brought Biggie with him as a founding artist of his new label Bad Boy Records. He changed his official name to \u201cThe Notorious B.I.G.\u201d as he began to prepare his debut album. His appearance on labelmate Craig Mack\u2019s 1994 hit \u201cFlava In Ya Ear (Remix)\u201d established him as one of hip-hop\u2019s hottest rising stars. During this period, he married singer Faith Evans, another aspiring Bad Boy star. His 1994 debut single \u201cJuicy\u201d and album Ready To Die, released in the fall of 1994, received critical acclaim.\n\nIn early 1995, Biggie\u2019s second Ready To Die single \u201cBig Poppa\u201d became a major success, garnering heavy rotation on MTV and hitting #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. His next single, a remix of \u201cOne More Chance,\u201d went to #2. The Source dubbed him \u201cThe King of New York.\u201d\n\nOver the next three years, Biggie played a central role in making Bad Boy Records a dominant force in hip-hop and R&B music, appearing on hits with Total, 112, Ma$e, The LOX, and Puff Daddy. Big also developed his own group of friends from his neighborhood, Junior M.A.F.I.A., who released two top 20 hits with \u201cPlayer\u2019s Anthem\u201d and \u201cGet Money\u201d from the gold-selling album Conspiracy in 1995. The group spawned hitmaker Lil' Kim.\n\nIn 1996, former friend and collaborator 2Pac released \u201cHit \u2018Em Up,\u201d a scathing diss track about Biggie. \u2019Pac believed Big and Bad Boy were responsible for his 1994 robbery and shooting in New York City, a theory aided by Biggie\u2019s suspiciously titled track \u201cWho Shot Ya?\u201d Big never explicitly responded, although many fans believe his late work is filled with subliminals about \u2019Pac, who was killed in September 1996. His murder remains unsolved.\n\nBiggie spent most of 1996 recording his second album and recovering from a car accident that seriously injured his leg. Biggie filmed a video for the album\u2019s first single, \u201cHypnotize,\u201d in Los Angeles in February 1997. A month later, after attending a music industry party in L.A., Biggie was gunned down in a car with three longtime friends while stopped at a red light. He was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead 30 minutes later. His murder remains unsolved.\n\nA week after his death, \u201cHypnotize\u201d became Biggie\u2019s first #1 pop hit, and his double album Life After Death was released to widespread acclaim and platinum sales. The album\u2019s second single, \u201cMo\u2019 Money, Mo\u2019 Problems\u201d also went #1. In the year 2000, Life After Death was certified diamond by the RIAA for selling 10 million copies. The massive critical and commercial success of Life After Death solidified Biggie\u2019s legacy as an icon.\n\nPuff Daddy, who released his debut album No Way Out in the summer of 1997, hit #1 on the pop charts with his Biggie tribute \u201cI\u2019ll Be Missing You.\u201d Bad Boy continued to have waves of success for over 20 years, during which time they released several posthumous Biggie albums, including 1999\u2019s Born Again, 2005\u2019s Duets: The Final Chapter, and 2017\u2019s The King & I (with Faith Evans). In 2009, Fox released a biopic, Notorious, directed by George Tillerson, Jr, and produced by Puff Daddy and Big\u2019s former managers.\n\nBiggie has remained a fixture in pop culture and an influence on generations of rappers and songwriters."

I got the hookers eating out my palm\nShe grabbed my arm and said, \"Let's leave calm\"\nI'm hitting skins again\nRolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken\nNiggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out\nBlows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out\n\n(Music stops\nIndecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing\nBiggie breaks it up yelling \"Yo, chill, man, chill!\")\n\nCan't we just all get along?\nSo I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn\nGet her pissy drunk off of Dom P\u00e9rignon\nAnd it's on, and I'm gone\nThat's that...\nAnd party and bullshit and party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit and party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit and party and bullshit\nAnd party and bullshit and party and bullshit\n(Now here we go, go, go, c'mon)\nAnd party and bullshit and party and bullshit\n\nJunior M.A.F.I.A. like to...\nUptown likes to...\nBad Boy likes to...\nBrooklyn Crew likes to...\n3rd Eye likes to...\nMo Bee likes to...\nWe like to...64Embed"

Big booty bitches!\nUsed to sell crack so I could stack my riches\nNow I pack gats to stop all the snitches\nFrom stayin' in my business, what is this relentless\nApproach to know if I'm broke or not?\nJust 'cause I joke and smoke a lot, don't mean I don't tote the Glock\n16 shots for my niggas in the pen\nUntil we motherfuckin' meet again\nHuh! I'm doin' rhymes now, fuck the crimes now\nCome on the Ave., I'm real hard to find now\n'Cause I'm knee deep in the beats\nIn the Land Cruiser Jeep with the MAC-10 by the seats\nFor the jackers, the jealous-ass crackers in the ****\nI'll make you prove that it's bulletproof\nHold your head 'cause when you hit the bricks\nI got gin, mad blunts and bitches suckin' dick\nThe funk, baby!\n\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk (Uh)\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nSo I guess you know the story \u2014 the rap side, crack side\nHow I smoke funk, smack bitches on the backside\nBed-Stuy! The place where my head rests\nFifty-shot clip if a nigga wan' test\nThe rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya\nHigh as a motherfuckin' helicopter\nThat's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdemeanor\nBeatin' motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina\n\"What's love got to do...\"\nWhen I'm rippin' all through your whole crew?\nStrapped like Bamboo, but I don't sling guns\nI got bags of funk and it's sellin' by the tons\nNiggas wanna know how I live the mack life!\nMakin' money, smokin' mics like crack pipes!\nIt's type simple and plain to maintain\nI add a little funk to the brain\nThe funk, baby!\n\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\nI live for the funk, I'll die for the funk45Embed"

I'm out like The Vapors\nWho's th\u0435 one you call Mr. Macho\nThe head honcho, swift fist lik\u0435 Camacho\nI got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics\n\"Make up to break up\" Niggas need to wake up\nSmell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure\nThen fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia\nShe don't remember shit, just the two hits\nHer hitting the floor and me hitting the clit\nSucking on the tits, had the hooker begging for the dick\nAnd your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick\nI guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown\nI was humping around and jumping around\nJacked her then I asked her, \"Who's the man?\" She said, \"B-I-G\"\nThen I bust in her E-Y-E\nYou might also like\n(Yo, Big, you're dead wrong)\nThe weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?\nYou're dead wrong (Yo, Big, you're dead wrong)\nThe weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?\nYou're dead wrong\nThe weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?\n(Who got it goin' on?)\nYou're dead wrong (Yo, Big, you're dead wrong)\nThe weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?\n(Who got it goin' on?) You're dead wrong\n\nWhen I get dusted, I like to spread the blunt like mustard\nTrust it! My hardcore rain leaves ya rusted\nMove over, Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, uh!\nLeave you toothless, you'll kibitz, I'll flip it\nTears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G's\nDisrespect me, my potency is deadly\nI'm shootin' babies \u2014 no ifs, ands or maybes\nHit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy\nSlit the wrist of little sis after she sucked the dick\nI stabbed her brother with the ice pick\nBecause he wanted me to fuck him from the back\nBut Smalls don't get down like that\nFound your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom\nSlit him down the back and threw salt in the wound\nWho you think you're dealin' with?\nAnybody step into my path is fuckin' feeling it!\nHardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy\nStab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me\nI'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen\nThe black demon, got the little hookers screamin' (Woo!)\nBecause you know I love it young, fresh and green\nWith no hair in between, know what I mean?\nThe weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?\nYou're dead wrong (Yo, Big, you're dead wrong)\nThe weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?\nYou're dead wrong\nThe weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?\n(Who got it goin' on?)\nYou're dead wrong (Yo, Big, you're dead wrong)\nThe weak or the strong, who got it goin' on?\n(Who got it goin' on?)

I'm a hustler\nBuckin' busters 'til they die\nNow it's on in the ghetto, you ain't heard?\nNiggas got they AK's headin' for the 'burbs\nAimin' at them skinhead bitches, let it rain\nGivin' 'em a wet welcome to the House of Pain\n\nIs anybody listenin'? Tell me can you can see\nThis darkness surrounding me\nNow it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder\nAnd it's gettin' hard to breathe (MJB)\nVision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried (Be worried, niggas)\n'Cause it's gettin' hard to see (Yeah, Nas)\nWhen you're livin' in the house of pain\n(What up, B.I., Pac?)\nWendy Williams say I stayed dusted, maybe I should\n'Cause these rappers'll have your phone tapped like Savion Glove'\nAnd on the West, yo, police corrupt, some are Bloods\nBut these Teflons I loaded explodin' some mugs\nI'm like Furious in Boyz n the Hood, but at the drive-thru\nI ain't runnin', I'm dumpin', crazy like a Piru\nAnd loc'd up, know how Nas do\nI'm callin' Henchmen and Concepcion, to organize a black truce\nThen we party hard, party with Nas\nSince there ain't no more - Mardi Gras and Bush won't apologize\nI got gangster hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize\nAnd .45's for them suckers y'all idolize\nY'all yellin' my name, but y'all soon dyin'\nTryna portray real but they be lyin'\n'Cause they want the real niggas to die so they could gain\nBut never that, this ain't Everlast, this the House of Pain\n\nIs anybody listenin'? Tell me can you can see\nThis darkness surrounding me\nNow it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder\nAnd it's gettin' hard to breathe\nVision's gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried\n'Cause it's gettin' hard to see\nWhen you're livin' in the house of pain13Embed"

Ooh!\nI flip skins like Mary Lou\nSo what ya gonna do when Shelton come for you, boo?\nI got girls that look like Toni Braxton\nAnd give me the skins without askin'\nWhen I'm relaxin' on my back and you know what time it is (uh)\nBut if it's red, man, I'll leave it alone\nShe can call me on my cellular phone\nAnd I mess around and pick you up\nTake you to the crib, stick you up\nPut on my Silk CD and lick you up and down\n'Til you say stop, hit the twat 'til your pops call the cops\nAnd when I make bail outta jail, I'ma wail on that tail\n(Why, Shel'?) Because the sex never fails, I am\n\nSo amazing, so amazing, so amazing and I been waiting\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\nYou might also like\n\"What kind of girls do you like?\" Well, that's various\nI like long hair, or them Halle Berry cuts\nReal big butts, yeah, thick with lipstick\n'Cause when it come to girls, I'm so optimistic\nLike the Sounds of Blackness\nI don't need practice in the sack\nIt's natural, I break your back in\nI pop coochies like my homeboy Luke\nGuaranteed to knock your trees off your Timbo boots\nYou don't get pussy-whipped, you whip that pussy\nHit it from the back 'til it get real gushy, baby\nGood sex is what I'm startin'\nI get the skin so wet, I make the ass start fartin'\nAnd I pray that dick don't slip\n'Cause then I'm hearin' this shit: \"That's not it\"\nAnd then I just ride 'til the sun rise\nAnd when I'm done, wipe the cum on her thighs, I am\n\nSo amazing, so amazing, so amazing and I been waiting\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\nThis is going out to the pimps and macs\nThat hit skins 'til their broad catch a asthma attack\nBut not even Pamatti Miss could resist\nThe way I jumped up and dissed the clitoris\nAll I wanna do is zoom-a-zoom in the boom poom (Uh, uh)\nSmoke a little boom, get some head in the bedroom\nAnd then I whisper soft in her ear:\n\"You ain't got to home, but you got to leave from here\"\nSimple and plain, no strings attached\nI'm lettin' you know that I'm a certified mac\nI hit skins 'til the leg cramps\nSo on the first I can get half the check and half the stamps\n\nSo amazing, so amazing, so amazing and I been waiting\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\nIs it my charm? I got the hookers eatin' out my palm\nThis is for the macs and dons\n\nAll the players in '94, recognize\nShelton D in full effect, baby, baby\nUh, uh, yeah, fuck all you bitches5Embed"

Picture yourself going out as a hero\nPicture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners\nFans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners\nNotorious tried to warn us\nWe watched, so many piggybacked off of\nBiggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap\nStatistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact\nThese tragic events, which lead us back\nTo where we left off on March 9th\nTo come from such hard knock lives\nAnd make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights\nAnd, once they're on us this is our lives\nThrust out for all eyes to cast upon us\nTo see who can last the longest\nAnd he who lasts the longest must be the strongest\nIn this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from\nIt's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving\nOr it could just be somebody's aura, that just horri-fies\nAnd applies to his persona or the sizes\nIn his entou-rage that intimidates the people\nTo the point that you know that he's gangster\nHe ain't just say shit, you just believe it\nYou might also like\nSince B.I.G. taught us niggas to think big\nI'm been about my business since then, so anxious\nIt ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn\nThis I took in, sent chills through my skin\nVicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him\nIt's what excited Obie to write these poems\nRolling, going through the same shit he spoken\nOpen up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies\nWhen Ready to Die was a sick part of my life\nPalming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind\nThen that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind\nGot me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind\nGet up out the system, who could give him better signs\nNo pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes\nSo possibly I'd be popular, huh?\nThat's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I\n\nI took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind\nInto the most phenomenal artist of any and all time\nI made a Frankenstein, my design impressed\nBackpackers and press who said my house was a mess\nCritics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passing\nAll I did was build a dynasty off of his passion\nAnd I'm addressing the adolescents absent to who he is\nThe original king of New York, Christopher Wallace\nThis is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna\nAnd teach her that with all the drama don't even bother\nOn repeat, all of your albums play back to back\nAnd I visit your grave 'cause our friendship's intact\nAn immaculate concept, extravagant progress\nBullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling \"God bless\"\nRegardless to critics yelling that East/West\nI seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset\nAnd when the resurrection of you shines through an individual\nLyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally\nI'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest\nWhether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga (nigga)6Embed"

I'm thirsty\n\nBig slam, quick slam, tin can, whatever\nWhether too cold or too hot, you got\nTo keep Pepsi in the freezer, I keep a 3 liter for my crew\nMy girl like them diet joints too\nFor when she watch her weight, crack the top I can't wait\nOther sodas taste the worst -- I don't even converse\nIf it can't quench my thirst what you in my fridge for?\nWhat you wanna live for? Life with the dry mouth\nHot like the south, flash out your 12 ounce and renounce\nNothing can beat the P-e-p-s-i\nYes I drink it constantly; cop it by the case, tastes great, less filling\nNon-alcoholic I can feed it to my children\nTell em Biggie said, \"Drink it all\"; don't test me!\nNothing else beats a Pepsi, if it is, let's see\nI'm thirstyYou might also like11Embed"

I'm out like The Vapors\nWho's the one you call Mr. Macho\nThe head honcho, swift fist like Camacho\nI got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics\n\"Make up to break up\" Niggas need to wake up\nSmell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure\nThen fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia\nShe don't remember shit, just the two hits\nHer hitting the floor and me hitting the clit\nSucking on the tits, had the hooker begging for the dick\nAnd your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick\nI guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown\nI was humping around and jumping around\nJacked her then I asked her, \"Who's the man?\" She said, \"B-I-G\"\nThen I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)\nYou might also like\nThe weak or the strong, who got it going on?\nYou're dead wrong\nThe weak or the strong, who got it going on?\nYou're dead wrong\n\nCheck the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger\nJump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya\nRip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser\nWatch me erase ya, misplace ya\nPut you in the back with the derelicts, yeah, I pop plenty shit\nChump, I'm making hits, no time for the crack rock and shit\nTook it to another level\nNow I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils\nAnother amateur trying to damage the pedigree\nOf the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me\nHoes, I thought you know I'm smooth as a baby's ass\nSmooth as Teddy Pendergrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass\nThe Brooklyn-born Teflon Don, wrecking shop\nGetting props, proving nobody drops\nWords as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit\nAnd niggas just can't understand it\nI bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton\nYou know my shit is hitting\nYeah, y'all, a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls\nKicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in their drawers\nFor the burner, catch a body, I got styles like karate\nJiu-jitsu, when I hit you then I split you\nLike a cantaloupe, hope you got a rope to hang yourself\nI rob for self; from Brooklyn, where else?\nFat like a Lexus coupe, I ripped your troop\nNot even Lois Lane could get the scoop\nWhat you think, I'm stupid? My crew is mad deep\nI hope you niggas sleep, huh, yo, Big, you're dead wrong\nThe weak or the strong, who got it going on?\nYou're dead wrong\nThe weak or the strong, who got it going on?\nYou're dead wrong3Embed"

I'm not the stick-up man\nI don't want the rings on your hand, I don't understand\nWhen I come thru the avenue I must know voodoo\nCause all eyes are on you know who - huh!\nAnd my so-called friends beg for ends for me to lend\nBut this bankrolls they won't spend\nI don't need 'em, let the welfare feed 'em\nWhen it come to 'wassup' the peace sign is how I greet 'em - uh\nSometimes they won't get that, sweating me for some chit-chat\nBite my lyrics like kit-kats\nOpen your eyes, realize ain't no sugar in my tank\nOut of all my friends, there's just one I want to thank\nMy man Big D taught me a lesson that was great\nThat good things come to those who wait\nAnd we've waited through the suffering and pain\nAnd bitches ride the dick like the A-train\nThat's why I flip, keep a burner to my hip\nTake a hooker to the crib, you know she got to strip\nStay dip, take out of state trips\nDon't drink a lot of Hennessy, I only take a sip\nI'm a skipper, like a captain, rapping is my specialty\nAnd the best is me\nSo the rest will see, B.I.G. don't need to practice\nI'm like a sharpshooter, shoot the needle off a cactus\nOnly thing I lack is stage fright and conceit\nI completely defeat the weak - uh\nEven the strong don't last long\n'Cause I'm Brooklyn born, bay-bro\nI'm not a paper gangster of no sort, don't smoke Newports\nWhen I get stressed I grab my vest\nPut a MC to the test quick specially if he talk slick\nAbout who we flipped then whipped\nI tripped the competition, stepped across the step to the big boss\nYou know, of course, they took a loss\nStepping to Big and the hitman 50 Grand\nLike sinkin' in quicksand, ya need a hand my man\nDamn, tried to give you the warning sign\nWhen I said chill, I wasn't sayin' LL rhyme\nI was telling ya not to flare up\nHe's about to tear up, I'm telling you not to erupt\n'Cause he just as corrupt as a DJ should be - huh\n50 Grand and I'm the BIG, Mister Cee..\nYou might also like\nYo, here we go here we go here we go here we go here we go motherfucker here we go\n\nCan ya withstand this kind of a man\nGettin in your ass like sand\nBut this ain't a date at the beach lil each\nAnd every mc in the place check the speech\nAnd I'll bet the dough from my show they can't get wit'\nMister Cee on the flow till I get bit\n\nNah nah nah nah nah love\nYou can't do it like that love\nYou got to ride that motherfucker you know what I'm sayin?\nYou got to riiide that motherfucker\n\nTry to get props on the brother, that pops the most and clocks the most\nDrops the most shit like a pigeon\nListen to the words I'm slippin' through saliva\nAin't an MC liver, I'm the rap MacGyver\nDoin' tricks with my lips so quick\nIf you blink you would miss the great style of Chris\nDon't try to diss, 'cause I dismiss, dissaprove, dissapoint\nRappers that think they the joint\nHuh, they'll get the point quicker\nFaster even, MCs I'm leavin' until you can't breathing\nYou call it a homicide, I call it a suicide\nTry to battle me boy you deserve to die\nPunch you in your eye, before I blade ya\nTo let you know that I can fight before I slayed ya\nCall me Chris, this I insist\nAnything different will lead to closed fist\nA wrap up, you don't wanna get tapped up2Embed"
