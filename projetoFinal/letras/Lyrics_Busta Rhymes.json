  "plain": "Busta Rhymes is a Grammy-nominated rapper, producer, and actor. Born Trevor George Smith, Jr. on May 20, 1972 in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York City, he would later move to Uniondale, Long Island but attended high school in Brooklyn with the likes of JAY-Z, The Notorious B.I.G., and Special Ed. Prior to his graduation from Uniondale High School in 1990, Busta joined Dinco D, Charlie Brown, and Cut Monitor Milo to form Leaders of the New School. The group opened for Public Enemy and their frontman Chuck D gave Chill-O-Ski the name Busta Rhymes after NFL wide receiver George \u201cBuster\u201d Rhymes.\n\nLeaders of the New School released two albums, A Future Without a Past\u2026 (1991) and T.I.M.E. (The Inner Mind\u2019s Eye) (1993), before splitting after an intense interview with Yo! MTV Raps. Busta\u2019s popularity began to rise with his appearances on A Tribe Called Quest\u2019s \u201cScenario\u201d in 1991 and its remix in 1992, as well as the remix to Craig Mack\u2019s \u201cFlava in Ya Ear\u201d in 1994.\n\nThis led to Busta releasing his platinum debut album The Coming in 1996, featuring the platinum single \u201cWoo Hah!! Got You All in Check.\u201d Busta\u2019s subsequent four albums all went platinum, while It Ain\u2019t Safe No More\u2026 and The Big Bang achieved gold status. He also released several international hits, including \u201cDangerous,\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s It Gonna Be?\u201d with Janet Jackson, and \u201cI Know What You Want\u201d with Mariah Carey, as well as being featured on the #1 hits \u201cDon\u2019t Cha\u201d with the Pussycat Dolls and \u201cLook At Me Now\u201d with Chris Brown and Lil Wayne.\n\nBusta appeared in the movies Higher Learning, Halloween: Resurrection, and the remake of Shaft among others, and he also appeared in the fighting video game Def Jam Fight for NY."

   "lyrics": "55 ContributorsE.L.E. 2 Intro Lyrics\nCurrently on Extinction Level Event 2\nGenesis, chapter eleven, verses one through nine\nThousands of years before Christ\nTyrant Nimrod, Gilgamesh of Shinar, enslaved the first empire\nOne world language, one world religion, one world order\nWe have learned nothing (One)\nMaking the keys to heaven a gift to the devil\nThose who desire to supplant God\nIlluminati who tempt and horrify us as the most perfect angel Lucifer\nSeek to rebirth a new world order upon the flesh, blood, and bones of all humanity\nAgain, towers rose skyward to challenge his divine glory\nTo conquer his serene domain\nAs in ancient Babylon, the one true Lord brought them down\nIn 2001, three became naught, conspiracy is reality\nFear is the weapon of thine enemy\nActs of terror a lie, told to convince the meek to surrender to their rulers\nAtmospheric variances melt the polar ice caps and drown the rats who walk on two legs\nAn incurable virus to decimate the dark, nuclear rain to set us aflame\nObscured by a curtain of venom from space in the name of science\nFall to your knees, pray to a last choking breath\nA new world order is here, arrogance over God means annihilation\nDaddy, what's it gonna be like in the year 2021?\nOnly He can save us\nThis is the second coming\nExtinction Level Event 2\nSee Busta Rhymes LiveGet tickets as low as $101You might also like\nThere's only five years left, nigga\nThere's only five years left, nigga!\nThere's only two years left, nigga\nThere's only one day left, nigga\nIt's the end of the world, motherfucker\nShit, we right here with Busta Rhymes, motherfucker\nThe baddest, the biggest\nHe been doin' it for the longest, been doin' for the strongest, bitch\nIt's the end of the world and these are the last days\nThis might be\u2014 this might be the last day\nAnd lucky you, on your last day\nYou gon' hear the Busta Rhymes album, you lucky bitch\n\nWell, it's the God (Yes), no illusions\nBlessings while I greet y'all in the absence of confusion\nWith science to spark the mind with thoughts of greater living\nIt gets deeper than secrets in Masonic symbolism\nAnd I understand if you can find it extremely hard to calculate it\nAs dude who refer to himself as God, let me demonstrate it\nIf you don't get it at first, revisit it later\nBut in the meantime, let's examine the difference in our nature\nAs in lovin' or hateful, patriotic or rebel\nPositive and negative, or in God and the devil\nIt's been debated for years, let's acknowledge the magic\nWhile some embrace the jewel, others'll witness it as tragic\nBut I'm addicted to exposing the truth, it's a habit\nSince a youngin' using a pencil to write the mathematics\nIncorporating the science while I give you the classics\nWhile some'll find it strange and resort to measures that's drastic\nI articulate with clarity, reassure when you hear this\nSome identity me as cuckoo or conspiracy theorist\nSome might call me crazy 'cause at times my life seems out of order\nThus possessin' answers to the total square mileage of land and water\nGo get your recorder 'cause even on my worst day\nWhen I'm lifting the weight on my shoulders, I could tell you what the Earth weigh\nLet me listen to the wind so I can hear the Earth begin\nThe universe speak 'round the celebration of my birthday\nThat being said, we can stop pretendin' that I'm mental\nLike all the shit we witnessed be happenin' coincidental\nSee, back in '98 when I dropped the first Extinction Level\nI was fightin' inner demons with personal scores to settle\nThey put it in a movie 'cause they knew that we ain't really know\nFunny how they tried to tell us 22 years ago\nWhat deeply impacted how watchin' a flick really moved me\nAs the world was ending, Morgan Freeman was prez in a movie\nSo, let's fast-forward to 2009\nOr 2012 when we left an impression on the minds\nOf the people makin' sure we remember if we slightly doubted\nThat the world was ending and we can't really do shit about it\nDamn, funny when I saw the flick, it did amuse me through\nTo the point that Danny Glover was prez the movie too\nThen I questioned why they reiteratin' the same plot\nShould we be a little para' now that they gave us Barack?\nIn 2020, the message I'm sending\nNow that my president gone, how convenient the world has ended\nI tried to warn 'em with The Seventh Seal\nThe world is wounded, it may never heal\nEven Mother Nature's gettin' ill, it's gettin' real\nWhen millions get killed when that deadly weather spill\nUntil Sodom and Gomorrah's on America's turf\nThe horror, it'll forever get worse\nYet and still, it's like a gift at birth then you inherit a curse\nBut the meek must inherit the Earth, it's Heaven's will\nMeek meaning powerless in the form of politics\nGiving power at the dawn of the apocalypse\nAnd war is stronger than peace\nIt's poverty 'til the majority is scarred with the mark of the beast\nSo the righteous prevail to work miracles\nPrepare to weather you through the unbearable and reverse the inevitable\nYou find you a sin, remind you of when\nBack when God lived in men and that time is again\nSigns of the end, read Mark chapter 13\nAnd Daniel chapter 12, understand you wrapped in hell\nRevelations show the facts as well\nThen read Prophets in the Quran and ask yourself\nDo you rep a nation bred for hatin'?\nJudgement Day ain't far, don't get left debatin'\n'Cause what they thinkin' is the end of creation\nIs actually the reincarnation of Gods, the death of Satan\nSomethin' just to think about a little bit, you know?\nAs I continue to bring y'all to a place where\nWe remind you how special it is to have\nA good balance of science, and a good balance of heat\nClassic shit, as I continue to give you that food\nFeast on this full course meal, as I welcome you all\nTo \"Extinction Level Event 2\", easy\nWhose world is this?

Maybachs and the coupes, too (Maybach)\nLike jewels, I'm just tryna pack a deuce-deuce\nDiplomats, Arabic how I'm makin' my moves\nRoad to riches, fuckin' bitches in my favorite shoes\nShe thought I had a seizur\u0435, told her April fools\nFuck a lawsuit, bitch I'm tryna make the n\u0435ws\nMaster Mohammed sold silks goin' door to door\nGivin' knowledge to the brothers fed who wanted more\nWe a nation of brothers, such a wonderful force\nGo straight to the Quran if you wanted the source\nI know God so proud you becoming the boss\nCold world with the flows, keep a nigga raw\nWe was sleepin' on the floors when they used to storm\nI just wanna get a home for my only mom\nThis a dream to make her proud of her only son\nThis a dream to make her proud of her only son\nMake her proud of her only son\nThis a dream to make her proud of her only son\nAnd I'm number one (Maybach Music)\nSee Busta Rhymes LiveGet tickets as low as $101You might also like\nLook at my Piguet, yo, it's about that time\nLight sparkle off my jewelry, it's about that shine\nMoney bust out every pocket, it's about that grind\nI school them dudes, especially when a nigga third eye blind\nCan't give a fuck about what's yours, only concerned 'bout mine's, nigga\nThey steerin' like all of this hypnosis it's heavy\nIf looks could kill, I'd probably die countless deaths already\nGillette razor-sharp shooter, shootin' star like a comet\nSwag gave birth to millions like Master Fard Muhammad, boss\nLookin' relaxed like I don't wanna be bothered\nI thank God for the blessings of paths paved\nAs I journey through a jungle of lions so unscathed\nUntil I speak in tongues when I visit my aunt's grave\nAnd hustle like a genius with strength of a man's slave\nIt gets deeper while he's singing his praise, walk with me now\nI bless the hood while I keep on bangin' 'em harder\nUnconditional a love as a daughter's love for her father\nAnd dream, flying through the clouds on the planes that I charter\nAnd documentin' moments in time, becomin' a martyr\nWhile I merge, the corporation's expandin' a little larger now\nFor the sole purpose, my people can all eat\nThrough the desperate folks occupying up Wall Street\nBut I'm torn while in the studio, givin' you all heat\nAnd their ignorance is bliss, busy sayin' they born street\nOn their hands and knees just like they walkin' on four feet\nDamn, look what they really turnin' us into\nA savage smellin' blood while malfunctionin' in the mental\nWith baggage through the mud that they draggin' until they settle\nI ration up success when I'm sniffin' a rose petal\nIf you violate the truth, your body with feel the metal\nListen to these words with the power to fuel rockets\nJust in the same time it's so perfect for me drop this\nIt's getting to the point where they beggin' the kid to stop it\nIt's hard to honor such requests when you're bathin' in profit\nWitness shit I said that's come to pass they calling my prophet, lord\nSpecial how I touch the people when I'm speakin'\nSo precious like a moment of watchin' a baby sleepin'\nInfectious like opponents that's always catchin' a beatin'\nFrom journeys that I travel and missions I be completin'\nPut the mic down and leave it with mama for safe keepin'\nHahahaha, wow (Wow)\nLet me hear that shit again, son\n\nTake notes!\nWrite it down, get a pad\nLearn, motherfuckers, learn from a god emcee\nAin't too many left\nThat's right, there's only a few out there, y'all\nMotherfucker, everybody talkin' 'bout Busta Rhymes\nBussa-Bust, a man you trust\nIn Bust we trust\nAshes to ashes and dust to dust\nThe only nigga we trust is Bussa-Buss3Embed\nHave mercy for the spirits still prayin' for me\nTimes hard, so forgive me if I smell funny\nSleeping in cars, it be real with no hotel

But I'm sayin'\nEven though we probably link up every now and then\nWith minimal convo, look it's really good to see you friend\nSomething I realize is I don't even have to mention\nIs whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question\nSometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me\nAnd some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately\nSee you was here, when it started to haywire\nYou're still here, walking with me going through the fire\nAnd I really love you for it, I know you all relate to\nOn everything that I believe and I appreciate you\nAnd just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name\nThe way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same\nSometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearing me out\nBut I thank you just for being there and for hearing me out\nI got a clearer view\nI thank God that you've been there for me, I'm here for you\nI made a decision\nDespite all the things that we go through\nI'm gon' to take my time with you\nAnd be a friend indeed\nI made a decision\nEverything's gon' be alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\nI made a decision\n\nI look in your eye and I see the pain in it\nLife's a game, huh, maybe the game did it\nI know I changed, they say the fame did it\nLife has changed, huh, maybe the game did it\nTwo friends, now in two different places\nAnd the mister catching planes, and you catching cases\nFriendship, we never based it on position\nNo matter the game, we both shared the same vision\nDecisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us\nI would come to town and never get up, with you\nAround then, things weren't so simple\nI had my own issues that I was trying to get through\nOutside chatter, messing with our mental\nOn the chase of funds, to trust, you can't forget to\nIt's the real friends, that you've got to tend to\nNo matter how far, just know that I'm with you\nI made a decision\nDespite all the things that we go through\nI'm going to take my time with you\nAnd be a friend indeed\nI made a decision\nThat everything will be alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\nI made a decision...2Embed\nI made a decision\nDespite all the things that we go through\nI'm going to take more time with you\nAnd be a friend indeed\nI made a decision\nThat everything's gon' be alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\n\nYes, let me talk to you\nSee when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough\nIt's like the devil's trying to work to give an idol up\nAnd though I'm blessed, I still got to handle the things I go through\nIt's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you\nSomeone you know that knows you and gives you motivation\nSomeone that you can go to and vent your frustrations\nWe always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere\nWhen you need them the most are they really ever there?\nSee, every thing be all good when we be having fun\nThe difference is really needing a friend than having one\nIt's good when your peoples are there to help your problems\nAnd help you smile about it while finding a way to solve them\nLook at here, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell you\nHow you hold me down is something I genuinely value\nI got a clearer view\nAnd being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you\n\nI made a decision\nDespite all the things that we go through\nI'm going to take my time with you\nAnd be a friend indeed\nI made a decision\nThat everything's gon' be alright\nGoing to stay strong and keep it tight\nI'll be there indeed\n\nWell, how you been baby?

(What up?)\nI'm sorry, your time has come\nNo God is present today\nThey need to be afraid\nYou need to be afraid today because the God of justice is present now\nThat's why he said, \"Vengeance is mine\"\nThe battle is not yours, the battle is the Lord's and God has come\nThe battle is on and the plagues are coming down\nAnd no, I'm not afraid, but you need to be and especially when you see what's coming up\nBecause as a man soweth, the same shall he also reap\nAnd when you have done the evil that you've done to us\nAnd done it to others\nDid you never think that there would come a day\nWhen you would have to pay for all that crap that you have done?\nThomas Jefferson said it right, brother\nHe said, \"I had trembled for my country\nWhen I reflect that God is just\nAnd that his justice cannot sleep forever\"\nWell, his justice has awakened\nAnd all over the world, the nations are turning right before our eyes\nAnd that's why Trump is saying \"We gotta make America great, how, when? Again\"\nBecause she's not great today\nPeople are not afraid\nThe world has taken enough of America's evil, so death is sweeter\nThe son been continuing to live under white supremacy and under tyranny\nSo, in all, I don't care nothing about them investigating me\nOr arresting me, or even killing me\nBut I'll tell you what\nI'll tell you what, I'll give you a little warning\nYou killed your last man when you killed Dr. King, you will not get that chance to do that to me\nAnd if it pleases God that you do kill me, right after you kill me, all of you gon' die\n'Cause I'm not here by myself, I'm not here of myself\nYou can see that God must be backin' me\nOtherwise, where would I get the strength to say and do what I do?\nNo, man, it's our time now\nSee Busta Rhymes LiveGet tickets as low as $101You might also like\nGod has sent me to make you all feel the wrath and cometh\nI'm here to heat up and beat the street up, I'm back to punish\nWhile Trump is present with a mouth screamin' louder than trumpets\nWhile you bow to the puppets, I'ma stand and stick around for the judgment\nUse the world stage with a God crown to put it down for the public\nThe Earth's in pain with a large pound of demonic indulgence\nThese devil consultants, when our streets whine, I read minds of the culprits\nKind of repulsive to expose 'em through rhymes that I'm pumpin'\nShit's kind of disruptive when I talk now, line up the subjects\nI'm tired of injustice from the popes, politicians and judges\nWhen you witness the abuse of power, sometimes it's seductive\nThen I question God, why create a creature that is so destructive?\nHold all your grudges and focus while you create expenses\nEvery man is free of choice, but no man is free of consequences\nHold your suggestions and listen closely, I study lessons\nCausing rain, hail, snow and earthquake and travel dimensions\nThe ground'll rattle, the Earth will rumble like a stampede of cattle\nEleven hundred twenty feet per second, faster than sound travel\nHow many more protests? How many more marches?\nZero results, it's so grotesque, don't even get me started\nThen count on my mama, she knows best, fight for the dearly departed\nGod is the armor, we so blessed, let's zoom in on a target\nFrom a certificate, a merit down to a felony\nFor one's actions of these, justices will reward a penalty\nPants too tight, nigga, it's been part of the plan, fool\nThey fucked around and made the demasculinization of man cool\nAppreciate my pop, never stop 'til the death of me\nRaise the silly men and I'll never disgrace my legacy\nFuck following trends that don't make us men is the recipe\nCare for your women, your mother and children, it's necessity\nIn the last couple of years, you niggas look like you need therapy\nMentally it appears as if the imbalance is chemically\nHow you gon' try to stop God's work?\nThat could never happen, even after I'm back in the Lord's dirt\nI'm here to present the impact of the Extinction Level Event 2\nI'm only here to present and bring the impact of the Extinction Level Event 2\nHail Busta Rhymes\nI saw him at the Grammys\nHe spoke with passion (With passion, with passion, with passion)1Embed\nWhat up? (What up?)\nI'm sorry, your time has come\nNo God is present today\nThey need to be afraid\nYou need to be afraid today because the God of justice is present now\nThat's why he said, \"Vengeance is mine\"\nThe battle is not yours, the battle is the Lord's and God has come\nThe battle is on and the plagues are coming down\nAnd no, I'm not afraid, but you need to be and especially when you see what's coming up\nBecause as a man soweth, the same shall he also reap\nAnd when you have done the evil that you've done to us\nAnd done it to others\nDid you never think that there would come a day\nWhen you would have to pay for all that crap that you have done?\nThomas Jefferson said it right, brother\nHe said, \"I had trembled for my country\nWhen I reflect that God is just\nAnd that his justice cannot sleep forever\"\nWell, his justice has awakened\nAnd all over the world, the nations are turning right before our eyes\nAnd that's why Trump is saying \"We gotta make America great, how, when?

a zero dread\nAll of this money I be countin'\nAnd my cup runneth over like a fuckin' water fountain\nAny nigga trynna front, I'mma show them shit that's ugly\nThrowin' bread until they jealous of your money, lookin' funny\nHold up!\nAnd body shit, that's what a monster do\nSee me throwin' this money and bitches like a sponsor do\nPut the gloves on and beat up a nigga like I'm Kostya Tszyu\nAnd

(End right)\nWell, let me get this shit off before it do (Before it do)\n\nLook, I had to compile this shit in a song\nIt's so intriguing, all this fuckin' satanic shit goin' on\nPlayin' with symbols and signs, devil worshippin'\nPeople talk like th\u0435y prayin' to Lucifer, but what happened to \"J\u0435sus Walks\"?\nYeah, we have demented thoughts, then you conversate with your savior\nAskin' for forgiveness while displayin' blasphemous behavior\nAt first, we seen it subtle, now niggas display it major\nAnd goin' out they way like they doin' Satan a favor\nAnd gamble with they life like rattlin' dice in a shaker\nAnother life forsaken, turnin' your back on your maker\nI'm only tryna cater to the facts and shit\nI'm seein' a lot of questionable shit, like the fuck these niggas believe in?\nBut now, we don't figure the same, your music is lifeless\nAnd your visuals lookin' like rituals and sacrifices\nMakin' deals with the Devil in exchange to be the nicest\nYou dead like your flesh was eaten by maggots and lices\nWe've all witnessed the change, now nobody wanna be righteous\nThe days we live is dark and unquestionably a crisis\nThe Devil tried to plant the fear from when we was in diapers\nAnd some grew up possessed, staring in the Eye of Osiris\nNow I know you see this shit while you sit and wonder what happened\nIt's strange how niggas brandish devil worship like a fashion\nThe signs of the times, clouds from the heavens open\nWhere birds fall from the sky and fish die in the ocean\nNow who you think you foolin'? We seein' the way you're movin'\nI hope you take the time to start thinkin' 'bout what you're doin'\nYou're playin' with a match that can grow into an inferno\nUndescribable, the burn when the fire's feelin' eternal\nI hope you document this and write it down in your journal\nAnd read it back to yourself while overcomin' your hurdles\nNow trust me and be careful of who you let in your circle\n'Cause the Devil fucks a life and will breed the pussy that's fertile\nI know it's gettin' cold and you're fightin' the war internal\nBody decayin', turnin' all grey and blue, even purple\nYou portray a lotta shit with no rehearsal\nBut in life, we don't rehearse, what you do can come back and hurt you\nAnd until then, watch how the Devil will work through\nLook at what you've become and what the Devil gave birth to\nAnd when it hits the fan, you'll be wonderin' where your folks went\nYour niggas'll disappear when the science gets kinda potent\nI'm just buildin', I ain't mean to give an earful\nJust carryin' out my duty, everybody just be careful (Be careful)\nSee Busta Rhymes LiveGet tickets as low as $101You might also like\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhymes\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhymes\nYou hear me, niggas?\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhymes\nDo you understand?\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhyme\u2014\nRetire, motherfuckers!\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhyme\u2014\nGod MC!\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhyme\u2014\nBaddest of all time!\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhyme\u2014\nBrooklyn, nigga!\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhymes\nGo to school!\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhymes\nYou know ya can't\nYou niggas can't fuck with the god Busta Rhymes\nOh, Extinction Level Event 2, bitch1Embed\nHope you can hear me loud and clear while I give you this talk (This talk)\nI hope I leave enough fuel for all the minds I will spark (Will spark)\nAnd while\u205fI\u205fcome\u205fto share with\u205fyou the realest\u205fwords from my heart (My heart)\nI hope you're ready for this truth 'cause it's 'bout to get dark (Get dark)\nYo (Yo)\nYo (Yo)\nYo (Yo)\nThey say the world 'bout to end, right?

Lyrics\nDaddy, what's it gonna be like in the year 2000?\nWell sweetheart, for your sake I hope it'll be all peaches & cream.\nBut I'm afraid the end time is near\nThe cataclysmic apocalypse referred to in the scriptures of every holy book known to mankind\nIt will be an Era fraught with boundless greed & corruption\nWhere global monetary systems disintegrate, leaving brother to kill brother for a grain of overcooked rice\nThe nations of the civilised world will collapse under the oppressive weight of parasitic political conspiracies which remove all hope & optimism from their once faithful citizens\nAround the globe, generations of polluters will be punished for their sins\nUn-shielded by the ozone layer they have successfully depleted\nLeft to bake in the searing naked rays of light\nWholesale assassinations served to destabilize every remaining government\nLeaving the starving & wicked to fend for themselves\nBloodthirsty renegade cyborgs created by tax-dodging corporations wreak havoc\nPissed off androids tired of being slaves to a God-less & gutless system, where the rich get richer and the poor get fucked over and out\nUnleash total worldwide destruction by means of nuclear holocaust\nAnnihilating the terrified masses\nLeaving in its torturous wake nothing but vicious, cannibalistic, mutated, radiating, and horribly disfigured hordes of satanic killers\nBanked on revenge, but against whom?\nThere are so few left alive\nStarvation reigns supreme, forcing unlucky survivors to eat anything and anyone in their path\nMassive earthquakes crack the planet's crust like a hollow eggshell\nCausing unending volcanic eruptions\nThe creatures of the seven seas, unable to escape the certain death upon land, boil in their liquid prison\nDisease encircles the earth, plagues & viruses with no known cause or cure\nLaying waste to whatever draws breath, and human-kind having proven itself to be nothing more than a race of ruthless scavengers\nFall victim to merciless attack at the hands of interplanetary alien tribes who seek to conquer our charred remains\nThis is Extinction Level Event\nThe Final World Front, and there is only, one, year, left\nWow, that's cool, I can't hardly wait!\nYou don't have to, because here it is\n(Because here it is, because here it is, because here it is...)\nSee Busta Rhymes LiveGet tickets as low as $101You might also like\nYo!\nCallin' all live niggas!\nCallin' all live bitches!\nWe have a job for y'all on planet earth\nFlipmode world domination in progress\nMotherfucker!1Embed\nDaddy,

I make the whole place warm\nThen hit you with some shit that make you niggas look deformed\nNow stay tuned to every Busta Rhymes coming soon\nI will King Kong on niggas like Gorilla Monsoon soon\nWoah, what seems to be the whole analysis? (Ha!)\nBusta Rhymes just be rippin' shit, type miraculous\nBang you on your head so hard (Ha), shit be formin' callouses (Ha!)\nLet me get this loot, so we can move up in these palaces (Ha!

Aah!\nWhat's going on, Reptar?\nI'm losing control here!\nWhat's happening?\nEverybody put on your seatbelts, aah!\n\nWe need to angle this situation the tight way\nSo that we can handle the situation the right way\nWhat does it take?\nWonder what will happen if we press this button\nJust to stop Reptar, he started shooting fire\nHow many things are there around for us to destroy?\nMaybe fire isn't the best idea for a children's toy\nReptar, you must be losing a screw\n'Causewe losing control again, so what we gonna do?\nHA.....\nHA......\nHA........\nHA\nCHECK IT!\n\nWhat are we doing and where we gonna go!\nSo fast the wind will blow dry your afro!\nGet out the fast lane, I said you're moving too slow!\nOn your marks, get set, ready, go!\nWhat are we doing and where we gonna go!\nSo fast the wind will blow dry your afro!\nGet out the fast lane, I said you're moving too slow!\nOn your marks, get set, ready, go!\n\nOn your marks, get set, ready, go!\nOn your marks, get set, ready, go!\nOn your marks, get set, ready, go!"

I kinda miss robbin' and stealin' (C'mon!)\n'Cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin' when I starved (Ugh)\nI was ugly, so I robbed; no one loved me\u2014shit was hard (C'mon!)\nWent to God once in a while when it got a little too hectic\nHe was the only one I knew that I respected (Why?)\nDidn't know why, didn't know what I was livin' was a lie\nIf I ain't shit, then why should I try? (Unh!)\nSee, plenty niggas die over dumb shit up in the hood\nReal good heart, but up to no good (Damn!)\nThought I did what I could, but I guess it wasn't enough (Uh-huh)\nThe Devil told me it would happen, but I kept callin' his bluff (Uh-huh)\nWhen it rains, it pours; now, my pains are yours\nAs yours are what's mine\u2014define revolvin' doors (Nigga!)\nSee Busta Rhymes LiveGet tickets as low as $101You might also like\n(Why?)
