  "plain": "Destin Choice Route (born October 31, 1990), better known by the stage name J.I.D, is an American rapper from Zone 6, Atlanta, Georgia. He describes himself as \u201ca soft-spoken but intricate lyricist with a cocky side.\u201d His stage name originates from \u201cjittery,\u201d his grandmother\u2019s nickname for him due to his sporadic behavior as a child.\n\nJ.I.D began attending Hampton University on a football scholarship in the fall of 2008. At that time, he was nicknamed \u2018Jidd\u2019 and released music under multiple variations of that name. His first mixtape, CakeWalk, was released in May 2010 and featured a number of friends from Hampton. The tape also marked two of his earliest collaborations with EARTHGANG. He released his second mixtape, CakeWalk 2, in June 2011. J.I.D was expelled from Hampton at some point during his senior year. Route of Evil was released in June 2012 as J.I.D\u2019s third mixtape. DJ Tay James, Justin Bieber\u2019s official DJ, hosted each of these three mixtapes. J.I.D does not publicly acknowledge any of these tapes, and they are not easily discoverable on the internet.\n\nIn October 2013, J.I.D released Para Tu, his fourth mixtape. Around this time, he also officially created the Spillage Village collective with EARTHGANG, Hollywood JB, and JordxnBryant. J.I.D re-released Para Tu on SoundCloud in December 2017 after fans had discovered it and were posting it online.\n\nIn February 2014, J.I.D and the rest of Spillage Village released Bears Like This, their first compilation. In July of that year, J.I.D released Lucky Buddha, a collaborative EP with Money Makin' Nique.\n\nIn January 2015, J.I.D released DiCaprio, an EP that ignited his rise to fame. Later that year, in July, Spillage Village released Bears Like This Too, their second compilation. In November 2015, J.I.D was an opening act on Omen\u2019s Elephant Eyes Tour.\n\nIn December 2016, Spillage Village released Bears Like This Too Much, their third compilation and the conclusion of the Bears Like This series. The album notably featured J. Cole and Bas.\n\nJ.I.D signed to J. Cole\u2019s Dreamville Records on February 20, 2017. Less than three weeks after his signing, he released his debut studio album, The Never Story, on March 10, 2017.\n\nOn November 26, 2018, J.I.D released DiCaprio 2, his sophomore studio album, which is also a sequel to his 2015 EP. Also, in late November 2018, his stage name was adjusted to JID (without the periods) on streaming services in order to make it easier for users to find his music."

I'm on the way\nIt's on the waist, I can tell the way you look, that ain't the case\nFigured you was mad at me when you said you need a break from the family\nAnd you not participatin' in no Pagan holiday gatherings\nAnd ever since I start rappin', I ain't never in Atlanta too long\nAnd I hate havin' to only see the family when somethin' bad happen\nLike when Granny passed, I ain't wanna answer the phone\nWritin' in my pad, hope I don't remember this wrong\nLast time I seen you, we was sendin' her home\nOctober, November, December was gone\nBut on the 25th, we gotta be there for mom\nI'm talkin' to you now, but can I see you tomorrow?\nI could be on the way soon as I finish this song\nSo you can see I'm still true in everything that I been doin'\nAnd I don't fuck with the Devil but I know he pursuin'\nAnd I know that Jesus died, thirty-three, like Ewing\nAnd he prolly did the same shit that we like doin'\nI know you got to feel the animosity brewin'\nIt's gettin' bad and I'm sad our relationship ruined over some trash, but it's past that\nSend me all the money that I gave you over Cashapp back since you actin' as if you\u2014\nWe're sorry, you have reached a number that is\u2014 (Aw)\nThat's fucked up (That's fucked, that's fucked, man, that's right)5Embed"

To regulate\nOffense is awesome (Forever)\nYeah\n\n2007, Cole dropped The Come Up\nI was in high school playin' corner\nI never dreamt of mumblin' words in front of hundreds\nStudyin' plays all summer\nI'll hit the league if my growth spurt come in, on my mom\n2009, bro dropped The Warm Up\nI was in warm-ups playin' Weezy\nAnd Yukimi, Little Dragon, flame breathin' the weed\nPatrick had the studio dorm room next to me\nI freestyled ov\u0435r his beats\nMy nigga Keese transferr\u0435d in from Tennessee\nHe's a receiver, I played DB like Aqib\nSnatch a nigga chain, Talib\nTalib Kweli, I could be lyrically, but I put on cleats\nScribbled lines goin' through my mind like a paper piece\nWhile I covered three, playin' nickel, doin' safety reads, watch the flats\nI can rap, but I rather tackle and pedal back\nGet a pick when my growth spurt hit (It don't matter 'bout the size, it's in here, man)\nI'ma be captain, and I was around 2010, no cap\nI got 'Freshman Player of the Year' and figured I was on track\nThis nigga Pat' been in my ear talkin' 'bout rhymin' on tracks\nSo after practice we record and then we got it on wax\nAnd on campus I heard about a couple rappers from Atlanta (Earthgang!)\nSaid them niggas was snappin', maybe we could make somethin' happen and shit\nI wasn't serious enough to even be curious\nAnd we lose like every game, so every day I be furious\nSo, the spirit of a nigga had changed\nTo the point I had to reframe and focus my skills for other things\nI took the steel wheel, I'm steerin' in other lanes\nBut my fuel on low and my oil need to be changed\nAmongst all the other shit that's goin' in my brain\nMy brother got out of jail, I only know him by name\nHe did a nickel and a dime in time, probably be stayin' with my mom\nAnd dad probably get mad, actin' lame some times\nYou might also like\nUh, look\nThe Sideline Story came out September of 2011\nIb said around that time:\nWe was huntin' for a record, under lots of pressure\nJust combine the leverage with a better effort\nYou could find a sound to get us out the underground forever\nMaybe you can bless a little brown effervescent kid\nYoungest of seven from the six, eight sections\nSection.80 dropped, yeah, we used to play that shit to death\nAnd if I recollect correct, you tried to sign him for yourself\nAll the while I was round my out of  town college, wildin' out\nRestaurants, Destin dinin', dashin', call it dinin' out\nFuckin' bitches, 'posed to be in class, but I was hiding out\nMy friends take a little shot, smoke a lot of cannabis, coolest nigga on the campus\nNow a nigga skippin' practices, and actin' like a rock star\nGoing from in the dorm to in the car, leavin' the football field\nBut fuck that, we still sorry, and the problems from the home front\nOn my home screen callin' me, I don't wanna answer\nMy brother Carl hit me, said my granny had cancer\nI'm 'posed to graduate and make my way back to Atlanta\nNo job, no money or nothin' from ballin'\nBecause between that and school, that was really all\nAnd maybe here's the back that broke the camel with the straw\nI wasn't on camera with them amateurs that they saw\nBut they said they still caught me and my dawgs stealin' boxes\nLike Craig on his day off\nCalled us in the office day before we 'posed to walk, uh\nCalled a squad car, a couple officers\nI know bro was finna tell, he was lookin' nauseous\nNow I'm sittin' in a cell, nigga double crossed us\nCrossed me off the list for scholarship because I lost it\nNo more football, my red-shirt senior season, exhausted, so I'm off it\nAnd I'm right back in Atlanta with a half a gram of weed\nAnd a gold Pontiac that my granny had bought for me\nI was sleepin' in the back, my dad kicked me in the streets\nWhen he saw my neck tatted, then I told him I was rappin'\nFuck school, no goin' back, he said\nIf I can not follow his rules, just go and pack\nTold you he be actin' lame some times\nThis my son, he came from these nuts\nThis negro come back from school\nAll tatted up like the Sistine Chapel\nTalkin' 'bout he ain't playin' football no more\nBecause he know he ain't goin' pro (Hey, it's a stamina that you left the house with)\nBut he left on a full scholarship to go to school and get a degree\nBecause we taught education was the number one thing\nAnyway (Every one of you gon' be like your oldest brother)\nHe came back, determined to do what he was determined to do\nAnd I know because he, he is, who he is, we taught him\nHey, whatever you do, put your full self into it\nSo he did that, anyway (Do it your best, damn what other people want)\nHe's back home, I ain't with that\nSo I'm sayin' \"Hey, you got to go to work\"\nAnd he sayin' \"Hey, this is my job, what I'm about to do\"\nSo I'm like \"Hey man, some times you got to work (Or don't be a partner)\nTo do what you really wanna do\"\nWe went through this whole brain wrestle\nBut anyway, he won (I'm standing by you)\nHe decided that \"Hey dad, I'm puttin' this thing, I'm doin' this\nThis is my job\" and he committed to it\nAnd hey, the rest is history (You can do anything that you want to do)\nI'm lookin' at him, I believe in him\nI know what was in him\nAll him and his brothers and sisters\nThey all got the same mindset\nDo your best, give a hundred percent or don't do it at all\nSo, I know whatever he put his all into, it was gon' be golden\nAnyway\nLook\nMarch 10th, 2017, The Never Story dropped\nAnd I'm comin' off of tour with ****\nThat was three years after openin' up for Ab-Soul\nBut it's EARTHGANG's set, I only came to do a song\nDoeBurger used to say \"Ayy bro, this lil' nigga cold\nKeep on doin' what you doin', you gon' make it, you 'gon blow\"\nI ain't know that Ced had went ahead and played my shit for Cole\nBut I knew he knew the game, and he pulled up to his show\nAnd then that's where we first met, but I ain't think of it no more\n'Til Ced Brown said that I should open up for Omen on my own shit, if I wanted\nOnly four cities, maybe we get Rob Gibbs on the phonin', I got to hone in\nIn the game grown men uncomfortable in they own skin\nBut all I wanted was a chance\nIt feel like I'm in a mannequin challenge\nStill stance, but I'm still standin'\n'Til my nigga lend a hand and I'm no longer stranded\nLookin' for strengths in the streets of East Atlanta\nMomma said \"Don't take advice, they gon' try and take advantage\"\nI was 'bout to sign with Coach K, I ain't take the advance\nCole say \"Hold on, wait, bro, I got the plan\nSo come on, damn, lil nigga, come on, shit, let's roll, fuck\"\n\nShsh, yo, that's crazy\nThat's crazy, yo JID, I remember\nI remember you came to the crib\nYou remember this? After we had met\nAnd I told you and EARTHGANG to pull up\nTo the crib in Carolina, it's the studio house\nI wasn't on no shit, like \"Yo, I'm tryna do some Dreamville shit with y'all\", nah\nIt wasn't no talk of no deal, I didn't even know if I wanted to sign niggas\nI just knew I, y'all was dope, I fuck with you\nJust pull up, let's see what the vibe is like, let's work\nIn my mind, if something happen, it happen\nIf not, then cool, niggas just got a chance to link and kick it\nBut while we was there, the thing that I noticed off rip\nI said, \"Oh, this nigga want it, this nigga really want it\"\nThat look in your eye, nigga, I know that look\nI know that look too well\nBut a lot of niggas want it\nThe thing I noticed about you my nigga, off rip\n\"This nigga don't just want it, he willin' to do the work that it takes to get it\"\nAnd that's the difference, that's the separator\nThat's the difference between the niggas that never get what they want\nAnd the niggas whose names ring out forever\nForever7Embed"

Who wanna rough me up?\nNobody, my hitters ready to bust\nKick in the door and I come out the cut\nWhat? Yeah\nWho wanna touch? Who wanna rough me up?\nNobody, my hitters ready to bust\nDo what I do and I say what I want, woah\n\nYeah, mama, your kid in a magazine, kid in a magazine\nI had a stack in my jacket at Grammy week, see the audacity\nI was a bad kid, bad city, you see the duality\nWho tryna battle me? Huh\nHitters is after me, cannot be that many, who wanna rough me up?\nFatality, really it's up, it's stuck\nUndoubtably, baby gon' touch the bucks\nMy salary double your baby daddy, maybe triple, I'm trouble\nI get the tackle and the pick and I hustle\nI had to have it, had to get in the huddle\nIn the gravel and rubble\nGot me a sack and I'm tryna be subtle\nWe just actin' like a dog with a muzzle\nSee the back-up, put him back in a puddle\nWe attackin', better stand back and watch and run\nShotgun come with the option\nSend big blitz, nobody blockin'\nBig win, that's a ring and a watch\nStrong end when he come in the slot\nTryna bend the corner, your limbs gettin' ****\nThat's your partner, then your twin gettin' ****\nAll you wanna do is talk, I don't even talk\nThought I heard somebody talkin'\nI could pull up with the Chewbacca, the\u2014\nThis ****, bangin' my chest and my head on the locker\nFeeling like Waka Flocka Flame, I put the opposition out the game\nI'm out the pocket, but I rock with the gang\nAnimosity reside inside of me, so I'm like a product of power and pain\nWho wanna touch?

You can make history, or you will be vilified by it\n\nWhile they were sittin' on they hands, I was standin' and plottin'\nWhen I be in my own world, It's like the world has forgotten\nMeditatin' in silence besides the loud in my pocket\nI don't want to hear nothing, a rat pissin' on cotton\nA rapper pissin' on rappers, I'm a Jekyll, I'm a jackal\nFrom rapper to rapper, you rappers PaRappa the Rapper\nShark in the lake, dodgin' the fake\nOn the line, I'm a snapper\nHeard you the best thing coming up, oh, God, I'm dyin' from laughter\nNo, I'm dyin' from living\nI been robbing and giving\nNiggas chances just to raise the fucking standards, wait\nHeard all the hoopla, faking, and all the antics\nCan't even count all the punches a nigga landed\nNationwide tour from the west side, then back to Decatur\nI ain't even signed this deal, girl, I'm just splashing this swavor\nBaby, you Betty Shabazz, you kinda match my flavor\nI'm a freak with a great mind, girl, a master debater\nHornier than the good Reverend Dr. Martin Luther\nCome here, baby, come and kiss on the king junior\nThen take a trip to the six, with me, it ain't pretty as Toronto, Canada\nGotta walk with the hammer here\nSmall things like that you couldn't fathom\nLittle forty'll knock the apple out of Adam\nLittle shorty sling weed and crack dabble\nUpgrade to full-time, where your tassle, where your bando?\nWhere the hassle when the cops jocking, blocking trying to find?\nWhere the guala and the drugs? Ollie oxen free\nHotbox topping foxy mama in a box chevy, monotonous debauchery\nObviously I've been out of it awhile\nYou should've got my things and sent for me\nEmpathy, empathize with my pathological lies\nDivide that pride and split the pot\nIt's only by God's grace that I made it this far\nThus far, I need his plus y'alls\nYou might also like\nEvery week, we\u2019re seeing new and undeniable events, evidence that accelerated climate change is here now. Droughts are intensifying, our oceans are acidifying, with methane plumes rising up from beneath the ocean floor. We are seeing extreme weather events, and the West Antarctic and Greenland ice-sheets melting at unprecedented rates, decades ahead of scientific projections\n\nWaiting on shit to pan out, why you standing there with your hand out like you looking for some change?\nI mean, I could offer that, but why would I offer that when you niggas could just utilize your brain?\nI want that right there, yeah, I want that right there, yeah, give me all that there\nYeah, want that right there, so, come on 'bout that there, I need all that there\n\nWe need it all, like\nSome niggas like, how he get on, how he get on?\nHe get on because he's supposed to be\nYou gotta work for this shit\nNiggas got great time, great time, great hustle\nThis is the time, no more weak shit\nIt's not allowed like, new rules, we on some new shit\nWell, it's the same shit, but we gon' teach y'all some new rules\nCause niggas make the same shit\nThis right here, it's gon' get you right\nThis is the motivation that you need\nTake notes, take notes\nDon't copy cause you can't, but you can take some notes2Embed"

Gun shots just a spiritual tune on some nights\nNiggas bored, they ain't got nothin' to do\nNo opportunity, community centers for after school, you can cool at\nFuck it they goonin', cop a tool my nigga move that\nFuck is you doin'?

Find this shit\nTryna tell me you the bomb, like all mine and shit\nI been all across the world on my grindin' shit\nSticky bud in my grinder, you can't grind this shit\nSuck a dick on your Insta and Vine but it's words you want\nAnd I promise, I ain't got the dime\nLook at God while you crying\nI ain't dying for a record to sell\nBeef not getting the money\nSo it's selfish as hell to the squad\nAnyways, if I was there, I never could fail\n'Cause JID major childish, Petty Labelle\nSqueaky voice, but the flow hold steady as hell\nMy wordplay wordly and I ate the gazelle\nThe other day and the girl, her name was Giselle\nIt was easy as hell, she was a jezebel\nYeah, uh\nI go an split a short with my shorty\nLittle tired, she been riding, Kentucky Derby\nLittle God bless this strong and hold it sturdy\nHold that shit down I don't wanna catch a murdy\nOvua, merci\nI never been in a Testarossa\nBut I throw this dick like Testaverde\nAll of them heard me\nJID so nouny and verby\nTalking about pussy pounding and slurping, wait\nBeen a long day, smoke until my head hurt\nRunning all the way, putting in the leg work\nRolling up the paper, take a shot of Jager\nShawty wan me swam in the pussy like a sailor\nShorty from Chicago, she love O'Block\nHop out the car, smoking out the whole block\nTryna pull me over, we don't fuck with no cops\nWe don't stop, we don't fuck with roadblocks\n\nWe don't fuck with roadblocks\nNah, we don't fuck with roadblocks\nWe don't fuck with roadblocks\nMan, hold upEmbed"

Y'all ready to go?\nI got division like Mansa Musa\nCan fuck your bitch like a barracuda\nUzi tooly Boolie, who the shooter?\nYeah, it's not mine, cause I forgot the ruger\nNever been a gangster, I'm riding with my seatbelt on\nTryna drive and roll up all of this weed in my palm\n\nTwenty-five to life, it all started with a coca leaf\nI swear I been the dopest this not how its supposed to be\nNiggas spent the bend and shot at everybody close to me\nAnd they killed my nigga T, dome shot, R.I.P\nNiggas killing niggas I ain't even get the notion\nThey out here catching bodies and a nigga ain't provoke em\nOh shit, guess I need to pick me up a strap now\nNowadays, niggas don't even know how to act (Bow)\nRun to the hills to avoid the high waters\nThey flooded the crops, kill pops, they tryn done us\nThey Marshawn Lynch with the Glock, they ran rumpus\nDunk us, Jordan signs seen clear when they stomp us\nSick of Atlanta, I hit my girl, then flew to Dulles\nBumping Dwele, dwelling on the past they ain't tell us about\nAll we do is accept they bullshit they sell us\nYou might also like\nOkay!\nNiggas ain't talking how they living\n(Mumbling, repetitive 'For real!' 'Okay!')\n\n*Do feel or do you think that it's a human nature that we always want more?*\nI think it's not just in human nature I think it's a characteristic of all life, I think opportunism and greed has really been the key to you know, survival\n*Can you relate to that, always wanting more?*\nWell, the truth is, it's you know, we all have good and bad in us and that, you know, you have to stop yourself, you have to stop yourself. You know and ultimately create a balance and think about others\nI think everyone can get into that addiction I mean it's an easy trap to get into, you know, on a personal level uh, you know I think that you find people like this and I've met a lot of people like this who's entire world is consumed by wealth. And and you meet them and you talk to them and you realize they dont have a lot of foundation in their life whatsoever\nAnd so therefore this becomes the root of all hapiness for them. And of course I like money like everybody else, that would be an absolute lie, but I think its important to be responsible at the same time. And I also think it's important to give back to if your in a privilaged position. I think that that should be  a pre-requisite to anyone who's gotten to accumulate a lot of welath in their life\nI think that it should be standard\nFor real\nFor real\nFor real\nOkayEmbed"

Heard they found somebody hidin' by the creek\nHad to identify the body by the teeth, no apologies\nConsolidate the evidence, corroborate the stories\nIt's a witness? That's your boy, givin' it up like, \"God\nTo all praise be the glory,\" monsters don't respond\nWhat's a Yeti to a Yorkie? Spaghetti on a fork\nWhile I'm playin', smokin' awful in a Porsche\nLike a forcefield, this the Lord's will\nI'm just here to make the green like chlorophyll\nGet a vagina in Virginia out in Portsmouth\nI be lit, I be lifted like the forklift, unfortunate\nI resort to Fortnite-type violence\nTell a nigga, \"Bored with all the bullshit\nSend me your coordinate,\" yeah\nYou might also like\nCheck, look\n\nI got to ball with niggas I was on them benches with\nI got the call sayin', \"JID, you really killin' shit\"\nI'm not a frog, bodyguard how I kick this shit\nI'm not as tall, your bitch could tell you where my inches went\nI'm not involved, the judge talkin' 'bout some sentences\nOnly sentence I fuck with come with commas, periods\nGive me some commas, on my mama, I'll build a pyramid\nAttitude XL Radio, I guess he serious\nOn some serious shit, who else you really bang with?\nI came with the game, flame changed, Big Jiddy Kane shit\nCold flow exposed, your whole tundra plain\nFuck you sayin'? Boy, that steal still stain\nKill, kill, kill, kill, them Spill-ville children\nShit, I made a million off of rap but I remember eatin' scraps\nSittin' on my granny lap, crazy baby with the naps\nI trapped fire in a capsule then I packed it in my satchel for the cold nights\nA ghost from my old life\nCrept into my home at like four at night\nTapped me on my shoulder, turned her on, I turned her over\n2Embed"

Where the fuck have you been in?\nI've been waiting on yo' ass, where have you been?\nDon't even answer that 'cause I don't want a goddamn answer I'm over this shit now\nI was waiting on yo' ass last night, in the house, in the bed \nFuck that, and fuck you, and fuck everything you're about, you ain't ever gonna be shit, you ain't shit 'till the day you die nigga your momma ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit, your uncle ain't shit your auntie ain't shit, your whole family ain't shit\n\nUh\nTypical night, invisible white, my visions entice my delights  the fucking lights\nAnd salt's getting thrown like rice after the invite\nSo the join of two beams you ain't feeling what I'm seeing so I'm leaving\nAnd I won't leave with no fucking demons, so I'ma place all my sins on the damn table, in front of God and whoever able to see the fables I created\nLies, imagination, and hatred\nDeath to making love, without really actually love making, faking it just to get you naked, flexin' and flakin'\nI'm a filthy nigga face it, but not just too complex to fuck with someone basic, That's a overstatementYou might also like1Embed"
