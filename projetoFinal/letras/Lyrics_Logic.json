  "plain": "Logic is an American rapper hailing from Gaithersburg, Maryland. He has amassed a large internet following and is a member of the RattPack, which stands for Real All The Time and his group of friends that he works with.\n\nHe is currently signed with Visionary Music Group and was cosigned to Def Jam Recordings in 2012 by No I.D.\n\nIn 2009, Logic unofficially released his first mixtape, Psychological: The Mixtape under the artist name \u201cPsychological,\u201d which was sold locally in Gaithersburg. Since then, he\u2019s released six additional mixtapes and seven studio albums.\n\nAs a young rapper, Logic drew influence from Wu-Tang Clan and took inspiration from RZA who produced music for Kill Bill Vol: 1, the film that got him inspired to rap. Another key inspiration for Logic was Frank Sinatra, as Logic developed the alter ego \u2018Young Sinatra\u2019 and released his first eponymous mixtape in 2011. He went by various names such as Hitman, East Koast Killa, Lord Subliminal, and Skittles before deciding on \u201cPsychological\u201d but then cut it down to just \u201cLogic\u201d so it was easier for people to say.\n\nIn 2013, he was voted as one of XXL\u2019s freshmen of the year, alongside notable rapper ScHoolboy Q.\n\nIn 2014, Logic released his debut studio album, Under Pressure under his label Def Jam, which fully dives into his childhood stories, such as gang violence, parent separation issues, and his journey to becoming the best.\n\nIn 2017, Logic started his own record label, Team Elysium, which was renamed to Bobby Boy Records in 2019. Founding members include Big Lenbo, Damian Lemar Hudson, and John Lindahl. Logic said the label was made because:\n\nI don\u2019t trust anybody else with the precious cargo that is my family.\n\nIn 2018, Logic released two musical projects, Bobby Tarantino II and YSIV, revealed his plans on making a movie, and admitted to writing two novels, one titled Supermarket, which released in 2019 and shortly after became a New York Times Bestseller. It was also accompanied by a soundtrack of the same name.\n\nIn May 2019, Logic released his sixth studio album, Confessions of A Dangerous Mind, which includes several collaborations with artists such as Eminem, G-Eazy, Will Smith, and Wiz Khalifa.\n\nIn July 2020, Logic announced he will be retiring with the release of his album No Pressure, a sequel to his first album Under Pressure.\n\nOn June 16, 2021 Logic announced his return to the music industry  under his stage name and released \u201cIntro\u201d just over a day later.\n\nOn July 30th, 2021, Logic released his seventh studio album Bobby Tarantino III, marking his first album out of retirement, and completing the Bobby Tarantino album trilogy.\n\nOn the June 27th, 2022, Logic released his eighth studio album, Vinyl Days, which would be his final project released under DefJam.\n\nAfter joining BMG as an independent artist, Logic announced in January 2023 that his debut independent album, College Park, would release on February 24, 2023."

Woo)\nI've been on the low, I been taking my time\nI feel like I'm out of my mind\nIt feel like my life ain't mine\n\nI don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive\nI just wanna die today, I just wanna die\nI don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive\nI just wanna die\nAnd let me tell you why\n\nAll this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it\nI've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic\nAnd my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it\nI know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it\nI never had a place to call my own\nI never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone\nWhere you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?\nThey say every life precious but nobody care about mine\n\nI've been on the low, I been taking my time\nI feel like I'm out of my mind\nIt feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)\nI've been on the low, I been taking my time\nI feel like I'm out of my mind\nIt feel like my life ain't mine\nYou might also like\nI want you to be alive, I want you to be alive\nYou don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die\nI want you to be alive, I want you to be alive\nYou don't gotta die, now let me tell you why\nIt's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater\nAnd it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover\nIt's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things\nAnd when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is\nI know that you'll thank God you did\n\nI know where you been, where you are, where you goin'\nI know you're the reason I believe in life\nWhat's the day without a little night?\nI'm just tryna shed a little light\nIt can be hard\nIt can be so hard\nBut you gotta live right now\nYou got everything to give right now\n\nI've been on the low, I been taking my time\nI feel like I'm out of my mind\nIt feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)\nI've been on the low, I been taking my time\nI feel like I'm out of my mind\nIt feel like my life ain't mine\nI finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive\nI don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die\nI finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive\nI don't wanna die, I don't wanna die\n\nPain don't hurt the same, I know\nThe lane I travel feels alone\nBut I'm moving 'til my legs give out\nAnd I see my tears melt in the snow\nBut I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore\nI wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore\nOh, I don't wanna\nI don't wanna\nI don't even wanna die anymore826Embed"

What a beautiful destination\nTo perish right by the Eiffel, come now\nPlease don't be spiteful of all my small talk\nI think we're overdue a long talk\nWhen I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad\nIt gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had\nAnd on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you\nBut do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?\nI'm two years clean, no longer a fiend\nYeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19\nAnd I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there\nAnd when the time is right I know that you gon' take care\nOf anything I need, of yo' family\nCan I have some tickets to your next show?\nWould you stand wit' me?\nCan I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?\nI forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom\nMy mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm\nMaybe you could tell *beep*\nI've been feelin' under pressure\nHey, what's up, bro?

Alright, nigga, hit me\nUh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant\nEverything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent\nI know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it\nI swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place\nThoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl\nIt fell through, man, what a world\nBut I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff\nSuch a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft\nThis letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss\nBrothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce\nMeanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors\nI don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior\nTruly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh\nWe ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?\nCome now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul\nSorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now\nI heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel\nHow my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?\nI ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined\nBut sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'\nThey say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth\nI should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth\nThis is everything I love, this is everything I need\nNever sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed\nThis is everything I love, everything I need\nNever sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed\nUnder pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure\n\nHey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don\u2019t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya.

I just wanted to be a kid and play\nTo this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats\nNever stolen, I'm from Maryland\nWhere they shoot you in the dark of the night\nLike Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon\nCatch me rollin' with the realest\nLyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero\nFar from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in Goodfellas\nIf your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella\nLet me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa\nMurder the game and then resurrect it like \"Thriller\"\nYeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa\nWe don't do it for the skrilla, we do it for love\nWord to my homies up above, we slingin' like drugs\nAnd overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)\nYeah\nYou might also like\nHip-hop\n\nI swear this music in my genes like Denim\nLyricism seep in 'em like venom\nYes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer, even though heaven sent him, uh\nSee my vision as I've elevated and risen\nOpen your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision\nI finally made my way up out that section 8 division\nNot by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'\nBut by putting pen to this pad and dispersin' these feelings\nWhile the label only care about making a killin'\nFeel my energy\u2014I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G\nThat's the shit they never see\nBut I own supremacy, number one\u2014I better be\nBitch, I said, \"I bet I be.\"\nTake my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me\nTell me, how is they gon' remember me?\nAs the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?\nOr will they be addressing me, talking less of me\nJust 'cause I was different\nJust 'cause I was doing what I love?\nAnd the fans say they love you, but they push and they shove\n'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it\nI just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid\nI just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it\nWorldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted\nWhile the rest of 'em just worry 'bout bitches and gettin' blunted\nStill that same motherfucker from that YS1\nOnly difference: I'm stronger and better from when I begun\nSo when people that never knew me, they tell me that I changed\nThat my music is different and my vision's rearranged, I just stop (I just stop)\nAnd do my best to refrain\nFrom having conversations with people that ain't in my lane\nWill I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?\nGive the world everything I have to give\nThis is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age\nUnderstand that I'm a man not defined by his wage\nEven though it's in the millions, that shit don't define my brilliance\nOpen your mind and maybe you can see the billions\nOf people that separated, but all equal\nTo know the ending, one must understand the prequel, uh\nI swear this music in my genes like Denim\nLyricism seep in 'em like venom\nYes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer even though heaven sent him\nSpit it like Holy water, prophetically repent 'em\nThen we gone280Embed"

What would you do\nIf suddenly all of your dreams came true?\nWhat would you do if you did it all?\nIf you ain't never have to lift a finger\nWould you linger like, \"Fuck 'em all\"?\nGuess that's your call, but I can't\nThis a marathon, not a sprint\nSwitch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint\nCan you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?\nYou might also like\nWhat's your name? What's your game?\nCome now, boy, just spit your flow\nFeel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?\nNovocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'\nIn my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know\nWhat's your name? What's your game?\nCome now, boy, just spit your flow\nFeel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?\nNovocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'\nIn my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know\n\nHow I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)\nBreak it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)\nHow I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)\nDown, roll it up, yeah\n\nSearchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits\nOnly led me to battle depression\nI done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain\nWhat if your life was under a glass?\nAnd people tried to dig up shit from your past\nAnd tell you what's good and what's not\nAnd every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot\nAnd don't give a damn that it came from the heart\nThey tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers\nThis here for the people that know what I'm sayin'\nAll of the people that know what I'm sayin'\nFuck social media\nTellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap\nThey always compare, they always compare me to others\nAnd try to hit me up against all my brothers\nNow, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?\n(Overdosin' at the crib)\n'Cause people just won't let 'em live\nAnd the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em\nBut nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside\nAnd they wonder why we all hide, shit\nMaybe I'm just overthinkin'\nOr maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'\nAnd when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate\nSit in the corner and think of a better day\nMaybe this bullet can help me to get away\nI just cannot seem to think of a better way\nEven though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'\nThat's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'\nEven when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag\nI'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least\nI ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)\n'Cause \"you'll never be Kenny\"\n\"You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole\"\n\"You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,\" yeah\nThese are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now\nThat make me depressed and they pullin' me down\nI'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown\nSo I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound\nAnd play it when nobody else is around\nWhenever I feel like I'm far from the ground\nGod, give me the power to battle depression\nYeah, round after round\nI wish I was famous, I wish I was rich\nI wish I could just get up out of this bitch\nBut be careful what you wish for\n'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be\nMy life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be\n'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division\nAin't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am\nDo what you love and do not give a damn\nFuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram\nJust mind your own business and be a good man\nBe a good boss and be a good friend\nSpread your imagination to the millions\nDon't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions\nJust spread that positivity for the children\nAnd all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em\n'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em\nKnow somebody feel 'em\nLast but not least, put your ego on the shelf\nAnd remember, love yourself\nNah, nah, nah\nPut your ego on the shelf and love yourself\nNah, nah, nah\nPut your ego on the shelf\nAnd remember, love your\u2014'member, love yourself\nNah, nah, nah\nPut your ego on the shelf and love yourself\nNah, nah, nah123Embed"

What advice can you give me?\nGod: What advice can I give humanity?\nAtom: I suppose so\nGod: Live your life. Don\u2019t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you\u2019re not your salary. You\u2019re not your house. You\u2019re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else\u2019s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all\nKai: Damn man, we\u2019ve been walking forever\nThomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we\u2019ll be there in just over an hour\nKai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?\nThomas: Oh no, man. I\u2019m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one\nOne, two, three, four\nOne, two, three, four, listen\nLook into my eyes\nTell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on\nThis front that I'm puttin' up for you\nI spill my soul into a microphone\nWith poems written in blood\nIn hopes that it's enough for you\nDo you love me yet?\nDo you love me yet?\nNo? Okay\nI'll go harder for you\nIn fact, I rap till I collapse\nAll I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson\nI'll never feel your approval till I accept my own\nCome from a messed up home, destitute and less informed\nAbout the ways to raise a child up\nTo not become a product\nOf his environment, I need to cry and vent\nBut I done built this wall up\nActin' like everything's all good\nBut in reality I'm lookin' for something\nThrough bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after\nNas, Cole, and Hov\nEyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'\nI'm used to being alone\nShit, you know how long I've been out on my own?\nChasing dreams, fantasies of a throne\nOne day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along\nTill then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant\nBoosting my ego with every million that spills in\nAnd still then\nI won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?\nWorrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap\nWhen it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved\nBy parents that was in too deep with the drugs\nNigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit\nBe who you are, identify as a star\nNo one tells you you're that\nIt's something that you just know\nThe world be stealing your glow\nYour mama did what she could\nHer life was miles from good\nYour father fell in the trap\nThey set for you when you black\nThey met when they was low\nAnd therefore you a product of that\nAnd so your trauma is deep\nDon't bury it you should weep\nAnd clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em\nJust my opinion, only then can you find peace\nJust start to notice happiness don't come from album release\nI've been through it before\nCan only share with you what I know\nTo be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you\nAnd you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try\nThis is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly\nThe truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky\nBut if you want to then you ought to know why\nAre you running from something\nWith hopes of becoming someone\nThat's finally worthy of love\nLet me tell you now, you're worthy enough\nFuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell\nFind God, learn to accept yourself\nAnd I'm gone, acceptance64Embed"

I don't know what you talkin' 'bout\nWhy nowadays everybody got a palm out?\nPLP, yeah that be me and that be what I rhyme 'bout\nI have arrived, all you rappers are in timeout\nRattPack, where you at? (Everywhere worldwide!)\nI know you been waitin' for this world to collide\nB. O. double B. Y., H. A. L. L., and Folarin\n'Bout to take it back like Doc and Marty inside the DeLorean\nI am no historian, but here to make my predecessors proud\nAll you bitch niggas not allowed?\nI put it on everything, I really want a cop out\nBut I did good for a dropout\nHop out the coupe, chicken heads go crazy\nGotta sound swag when the flow get lazy\nWhat up? What good? Where you at? What you been on?\nAnybody steppin' to me, promise they get shit on\nBetter hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to\u2014\nHop up on the\u2014hop up on the train 'fore you miss the chance to get on\nMixtape Bobby, that's the type of shit I spit on\nWoo!\nYou might also like\nAnd it's on now\nEverybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)\nGet in the zone now\nOhh, no, no, no (I'll be

survive\nGotta survive, gotta survive (Wale though)\nGotta survive, I said you gotta survive (Yeah, RattPack, Blue Moon)\n\nUh, smooth criminal, Mike Jack\nThrow a subliminal, put your woman in black dress\nThey was in Timberlands, I was reppin' them Nike boots\n'Member them nights that momma couldn't come right back\nI'm on the path right now, put the plight on the mic\nIf I write mine down, I incite my crowd\nI put Solbiato down (wholetime, wholetime!)\nUsed to go to Mark Twain, Mo County co-signed me\nGot many flows that any ho would vouch for\nI got many foes cause many hoes be out for\nHad the Penny Foams, remember those was copper\nHad so many homies talkin' 'bout, \"How you got those?\"\nI'm Phil Knight in real life, I'm real Nike\nIt's flight club in my house, they not like me\nMore than likely they ain't got the heart to fight me\nIt's a lie, somebody seein' me needs some Visine, yeah\nLet me let it breathe\nSaint Laurent level, weather never worry me\nI'm well aware they be wildin\u2019 when they talkin' me\nThey bitches in the ballot but whenever I be on the scene, oh\nHammers in the Uber, I be limousine though\nDiamonds lookin' fluke but I got the same glow\nAnd I got a juice back around the way though\nMy chain like a penguin's Pellegrino (woo!)\nWe cold, we cold\nUsed to be in LakeForest with the Kobe fro\nEddie Bauer coat, Foams and a load of dope\nBoat load of white hoes I sold it to nigga\nI was tryna survive, tryna survive\nI was tryna survive, yeah, yeah\nI was tryna provide, I was tryna survive\nI put it down every time\nGot some niggas alive, I got some niggas that not\nPour a little of brown liquor and look in the sky\nBeen the talk of the town, nigga, Virginia, Maryland\nDid it all for the capital, hope you haven't forgot\nHoes love me a lot, niggas hate me a lil\nAnybody can hear me for real give me they props\nHookin' up with a couple models, nobody's gon' try to play us\nThe motto is get your paper and make you a lot\nPulling up with the Young Sinatra, I'm looking like Sammy Davis\nThe MGM or the Vegas to shake up the rocks\nAnd the Stadium poppin', the Palladium poppin'\nIt's a fifty a place nigga, she thinkin' about it\nI'll be damned\nAnd it's on now\nEverybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)\nGet in the zone now\nOhh, no, no, no (I'll be damned)\nI said it's on now\nEverybody know that

But yet, God's mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved!\"\n\nYeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nY-Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah yeah\nYeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nY-Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah yeah\nThis concludes the Under Pressure program...\nArjun Ivatury118Embed"

black man\nLong ago before the white man\nCould paint the black man with a gun in his hand\nTake it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first white man\nAt the very moment when they looked around and said\n\"Fuck it, I\u2019ma steal this land\"\nTake it back, take it way back\nTake it way way back to the first black man\nLong ago before the white man\nCould paint the black man with a gun in his hand\nTake it back, take it way back\nTake it way way back to the first white man\nAt the very moment when they looked around and said\n\"Fuck it, I\u2019ma steal this land\"\n\nTake it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to about 1990\nShady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland\n7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born\nTo a black father and a white mother\nFather that wasn\u2019t there\nAddicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs\nSame as his mom\n(Way, way back)\nSo I\u2019m gonna tell you about that, right?\nAnd I\u2019m gonna tell you about how\nAll this young boy ever wanted was happiness\nAll he ever wanted was positivity\nAll he ever wanted to do was entertain\nAnd this boy went through hell\nYou gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy\n'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have\nAll these black babies with black men but you racist\nLike bitch, that don\u2019t make no sense, but it is what it is\nYou know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger\nThe kids at school callin' him a cracker\nIdentifying as black, looking as white\nBeing told what you can or can\u2019t be\nThis kid went through everything\nHe went through...\nHe saw narcotics in the household\nViolence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped\nThere was crazy shit that happened to this kid\nAnd he persevered while the whole world said\nWhat they said?\nSaid you wouldn\u2019t be shit!\nYou ain\u2019t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'\nNothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing\nAnd I, and he, he said fuck that, I\u2019ma persevere\nAnd that\u2019s why the message is always peace, love and positivity\nSee, he always saw things from two sides\nHe always saw things from two sides\nHe always knew that the message\nEverybody was born equal\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\nHe knew that because he saw that\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way)\nBecause he was stripped and torn down\nBy his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated\nAnd that did not know\nAnd he was stripped and he was torn down\nBy his white side that did not know\nThese people that are ignorant\nThat cannot see the bigger picture\nThat must fight and kill and murder each other\nBut once again, all he ever wanted to do\nWas spread a message of equality\nFor every man, woman, and child\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nNow imagine this child growing up\nAnd seeing the craziest shit\nBeing a part of the craziest shit\nRunning around with the wrong people\nRunning around with guns and knives\nAnd fighting and stealing and, and all this\nBecause he didn\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t know!\nBut he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn\u2019t right\nAnd he knew that he needed to get away from it\nNow I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old\nThis child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself\nTwo jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings\nAnd then he would then come home\nTo about eight or nine hours of sleep\nBut spend four, five, six hours of that\nWorking on music, persevering\nGrabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror\nAnd pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people\nJust chanting his name\nHoping that it would happen\nBut the, but the, but the world said no!\nMothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no\nYa nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka\nNo-no!\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nAnd he said fuck that\nHe said peace, love, and positivity\nHe said equality for all man\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah\nNow I want you to also imagine\nPeople telling him that he did not live this life\n\u201cYou just a white boy\nYou ain\u2019t never experienced that shit\nYou from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there\nOh no, no, we know, we weren\u2019t there\nWe didn\u2019t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household\nWe didn\u2019t live with the narcotics and violence in your household\nWe just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside\nOutside, outside, outside, outside\nAnd since you white, you gotta have money, right?\u201d\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first black man)\nAnd this young man persevered in spite\nOf what people told him he was, wasn\u2019t, and would never be\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first black)\nAnd that man is here today, proud\nA lover of all human beings\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah\nAnd he\u2019s here to say:\nEven though we\u2019re all born and created equal\nWe are not treated equally\nThere\u2019s extremists on every side\nAnd you should just do your best to live life\nAnd let other people believe whatever they wanna believe\nAs long as they\u2019re not hurtin' anybody\nYou can believe they\u2019re going to hell\nYou can believe it\u2019s not right\nYou can believe you\u2019re superior, fine\nJust stop killing each other59Embed"

O.D.B, comin' through like Killa Bee\nEver since I heard Enter the 36 in '93\nYou cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered\nFuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered\nNot even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender\nMy agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)\nYeah, we live and thorough\nAssassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough\nFrom Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem\nAll the way to Maryland, yeah, we comin' for all 'em\nBobby Tarantino to the Digital\nMy shit is pivotal, smokin' chronic, no medicinal\nWho you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?\nThe one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone\nYou might also like\nAy-yo, Logic, what up?\nWe gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style\n\nYo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!\nGuess who stepped in the room\nIt's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more cake\nIntelligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes\nGuillotine your head, last scene in the showcase\nPush weight, this Colgate, tre-eights and old gates\nExfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate\nWe wear robes that you can't even pronunciate\nWe eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate\nCribs where the floor just rises up and rotates\nLocations low-key, can't even locate\nTwin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates\nTeam makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates\n\nYo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades\nIt gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge\n57 MB, yo, metallic green, seats is piped off\nSeize 'em old tracks, unite through 'em\nThe kitchen is my palace, get your dance on\nWhile we just levitate with trees, get your branch on\nI'm known to wil\u2019 out, put the cams on\nJewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on\nA specialist when I'm bakin'\nRhymes be comin' out, we makin'\nWe challengin' these chumps for lumps\nHere's the statement\u2014stop hatin'\nThe crew is all about gettin' this cake in\nYou know about me, you relatin'\nThe enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA\nBoth lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures\nMixtures of hipsters, weed smokers, and beer drinkers\nPrince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers\nCake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin\nHuggin' all four boroughs, puffin' herb with my cousin\nAcademically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'\nI felt it comin' like The Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'\nSporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin\nIII-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten\nThe travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted\nDiluted, broken down to a catastrophe\nBut cats still get the trophy, hit y'all with that \"Okie-dokie\"\nBurt Reynolds, Bandit, goddamnit\nWhere the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one?\nI got a light-beam gun\nI'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from\nBut you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery\nMy verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity\nYou can never get rid of me, step back and consider me\nWu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry\n\nOld school on this track, I feel invincible\nThis new school ain't really got rules and lack the principles\nGot more clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical\nThe gun, Smokey Robinson, you need a Miracle\nGo back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical\nWhen nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals\nThe stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals\nY'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable\nWitty unpredictable torture over your physical\nStruggle bar, used to pour water over the cereal\nAnother bar, reppin' my squad, not individual\nBut one Nation under God, that's indivisible\nMy time critical, hands off I'm digital\nMe and my Ladybug, back when the planet was Digable\nI'm cool like that, my cash rule like that\nI'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on\nIt's only Logic, we got 'em mobbin' in the mosh pit\nFifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics\nThe hot shit I drop quick\nMajor player, watch my stock lift\nRazor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what\nSound boy, turn that music up\nNaysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up\nDeadly melody, the sickness, the remedy\nEverything circulate back around eventually\nWitty unpredictable, talent all-natural\nGame, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins\nTwenty-five years, still more of the same\nThe flow like water with the boilin' flame\nINS, your highness, they callin' my name\nBoy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain\nIn our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same\nTell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain\n\nSurvival of the fittest be cold days with no money\nThey don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me\nYou know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty\nSo I ain't down if you ain't talkin' that band language\nDear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it\nAn airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it\nBut money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it\nI'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it\nDo it for the Cs, they understood the game with it\nWe gave birth when we understood the pain with it\nWhen we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger\nWe killin' each other, but we all got the same anger\nNever go against the grain, homie, that's hateful\nAnother day in the life for us to be grateful\nSpread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful\nIt's better to stay full, so let's make moves\nI know your momma told you that I was a great dude\nThese dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you\nOn some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you\nWhat? What, what? They might Crystal in the Lake you\n\nBoom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off\nOur Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off\nSmoke and roast ya, the No. 9 Potion\nPull that shit, son, we open the ocean\nWho gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'?\nYou get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'\nThat's another level of emotion\nFood stamps niggas doin' grocery\nPolice wanna grope me\nPerp walk, then nigga street-talk\nWe bury niggas in sea salt\nI carry the torch where I leave off\nI'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on\nI rip off a shoulder to lean on\nIt's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains\nAnd none of my rhymes is two and the same\nNigga get cooked on a open flame\nI'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained\n\nCheck it, uh\nMy rhyme starts riots in the mountains\nThirty-six million and countin'\nThe harder they come, the harder I go\nLoosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?\nStay on my tip-toes, old-school Wu beat\nThis is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'\nWhere I come from it stays snowin'\nThe grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door\nBeez bang bong in your jaw\nI hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor\nStars and bars, makes me a general\nAnything less, makes me a criminal\nGotta dig deep for these Wu-Tang minerals\n\nG.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C\nOn the count of three, Wu-Tang\nFirst, master your breathin'\nI'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'\nI'm a champion from Brooklyn\nI'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners\nAvenger, a righteous defender\nGrandmaster from the 36th Chamber\nToad style is mentally strong, so strengthen your arms\nTo hold my microphone you need iron palms\nRemain calm, Jamel Irief\nWise chief, Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah\n\nEnter a world of a universal mind of one kind\nA thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme\nFood for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning\nRegardless, I speak logic\u2014clear reasoning\nThe uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz\nSelf-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts\nA point-of-view of the thinkers\nMonumental architecture, amazing as the Incas\n\n(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)\nW.T.C., ah-ha\nThe faculty\nAin't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move\nNobody slide, nobody get hurt\n\nEn garde, I'll let you try my Wu tang style\nI'd like to try your Wu tang style, let's begin, then\nShaolin shadowboxing and the Wu tang sword style\nIf what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous\nDo you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me?64Embed"

I penetrate it and innovate it\nWhile they emulate it, give a fuck if I'm hated\nI'ma do it 'til I get it, fuck a nominated\nBitch, I dominate it\nYeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID\nChilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E\nNot many get to do what I do, and now enemies\nThinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me\nBut let's get back to the music, I'm gone\nOutside of this solar system, I'm searching for paradise\nLivin' the life, bitch, I've been a vet\nFuck all these cats on the internet\nI love hip-hop and I hate hip-hop\n'Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot\n'Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sakes\nPac did the same shit, just on a drum break\nNow, I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game\nWe all people, all equal\u2014now let me let off, yeah (Yeah, uh, uh)\nNow let me let off\nTougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify\nTalib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by\nTwo words, Mos Def, in my headphones\nBlack on one side, now I'm in another zone\nSwitch flows, fuck 'em up\u2014play the game, run 'em up\nYeah, I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck\nAll the people want is real, guess that's why Logic appeal\nAll the power in the world; hold that, tell me how that feel?\nRacism on television and magazines\nPaying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, goddamn\nCountry don't give a fuck who I am\nJust a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand\nAnd I am, here's to the Roc\nThe .45 Glock that my older brother pop\u2014shot\nAnd I am, finally on top; too high up, not a drop\nStop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap\nI am, livin' like I ain't got it\nSpit the flow so robotic, man, who gives a fuck about it?\nMaryland 'til I die, but had to get the fuck up out it\nI love it and hate it, you probably don't know, man, I doubt it93Embed"

yourself\nBut you ain\u2019t focused on what's important: mentality, health Everybody in the world only want one thing, what's that?\nInfinite power and a pocket full of wealth\nIts like ohhh I'ma

basics\nI'ma get up, get on\nThat\u2019s what I been on\nFuckin' with your mind, tryna turn shit on\nBut they want to paint me as a villain\nEven though I\u2019m here to open their mind\nThrough the rhyme of life\nI gotta open their mind and design the right time\nTo make a decision and get in 'em like an incision\n'Cause I'ma hit 'em and give 'em livin'\nThey wonder what I\u2019m giving, I'ma never give in\nI gotta let everybody know\nI'm in their mind right now\n\nI\u2019ma get up in your mind right now\nMake you feel like dying right now\nI\u2019ma make you pray to God\nTo the good old

somehow, someway\nI remember somehow, someway\n\nIt was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood\nI stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars\nWhen suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic\nAs my body began to fade\nIn this moment my mind was full of clarity\nBut my body insisted it was in danger\nI looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine\nBut I was convinced that something was wrong\nBefore I knew it I felt as though I was going to\nFall and fade away\nMy body grew weak\nAnd soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety\nI refused to believe this story\nI searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me\nI began to feel detached from reality\nI felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass\nI got blood work done\nAnalysis of my mind and body to no avail\nThe doctor said it was anxiety\nBut how could it be anxiety?\nHow could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?\nHow could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?\nDerealization\nThe sense of being out of one\u2019s body\nI\u2019m not here\nI\u2019m not me\nI\u2019m not real\nNothing is\nNothing but this feeling of panic\nNobody understands\nNobody knows the sufferings\nThis physical feeling\nIt can\u2019t be anxiety\nIt can\u2019t\nOr can it?\nCan it in fact be the mind controlling the body?\nYeah, of course\nI\u2019m so in control of my mind and my body\nBut I\u2019m subconsciously forcing myself into a state\nOf self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind\nI am unhappy\nNot with life\nBut with this feeling\nI am scared, I am human, I am a man\nBut I look in the mirror and I see a child\nI am an adult who recognize grown ups don\u2019t really know shit\nAnd they never did\nAnd it scares me\nCause now I\u2019m just a grown up who doesn\u2019t know shit\nBut one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me\nNo, no this feeling\nThis anxiety is nothing\nI have anxiety\nJust like you, the person I wrote this for\nAnd together we will overcome this feeling\nWe will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge\nThat we are alive\nAnd any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted\nWe will rejoice in this gift that is life\nWe will rejoice in this day that we have been given\nWe will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves\nStarting with mental health\nWe will accept ourselves as we are\nAnd we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror\nWe will accept ourselves\nAnd live with anxiety32Embed"

We'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows\u2014we can't earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that\u2014and uh\u2014forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time...\nYou'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don\u2019t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you\u2019re doing, it doesn't matter what it is\u2014somebody is interested in everything\u2014anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...\nBut, it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, is we're bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living\u2014in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up \"their\" children, to do the same thing. So, it's all retch and no vomit\u2014it never gets there. Therefore, it's so important to consider this question...\n\"What do I desire?\"\n\nThe Incredible True Story\nAnd Transformation of the Man Who Saved the World\n\n\nSurface contact in 400 meters...\n300 meters...\n200 meters...\nTime of day is 6:28 Constant Meridian\n328 feet...\nOxygen: 100%\nTemperature is 17 degrees Celsius\nMan... what are the chances that there's some big-ass creature out there that's going to eat us?\n100%\n(Laughter)\n\nFuck...\n\nClear skies\u2014\nKai, which Tarantino film do you think Logic liked best?\nI would definitely have to probably have to say Kill Bill\n114 feet\u2014\nMan, stylistically he's like\u2014what\u2019s the name of that bitch? The lead character? I forgot her name, but he's like that bitch\u2014with like some Kung-Fu shit he's like with his raps. It's fucking crazy!\nYou know in\u2014in Pulp Fiction I mean\u2014the way Tarantino constructed his shots, it's the same feel for me with his raps you know? There's thought behind it...\nNo, I could see that, I could see that but...\nBut nah man, fuck that man! Kill Bill was the shit!!\nEspecially like knives throwing and dodging and shit\u2014and then fucking hot chicks fucking fighting each other and cutting each other's heads off! What the fuck is that?!\n\nYeah, fuck it\u2014\n\nPrepare for surface landing!\n\nYou're right, hot chicks and Kung-Fu, can't beat that...\n\nYeah, can't beat that at all...\nSurface contact in:\n10... 9... 8... 7... 6...\n5... 4... 3... 2... 1!\n\nAre you ready for this?\n\nAre you?\n(Sounds of birds chirping, air, etc.)\n\nWait, wait\u2014what's that sound?\n(Sounds grow, then abruptly stop)\n\nLife...50Embed"

Pass the Phillie, get silly, that's on the really\nWe snappin' like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, I'm talkin' achilles\nTry to play me like I ain't me, but I provided all the deets'\nWho you know worth 50 million, still rappin on break beats?\nFrom Nasty Nas, Big-L, Tribe, The Roots, and many more\nOf course we could never forget Biggie and young Shakur\nFuck the police, no we ain't fuckin' with Al Pastor\nI'm the bastard that mastered the flow, I said it once before fa' sho'\nWhile 6ix produce the kicks from the soul, you already know\nFuck these youngins talking outta they ass with no class\nI'm here to school 'em\nThis that real shit, I'm never foolin'\nI'm killin' these squares, we call it a massacre\nI got the bread, but these fuckers need the dough like a baker\nThe legends above me love me like the RZA, like Nas, like Jay 'Cause I mastered the flow from back in the day\nRespected by my peers from Drizzy to Cole to Kenny\nThank you for the love and inspiration plenty\nYeah, I'm loved by many, and only hated by a little\nNow I think it's time to switch to lyricism, peep the riddle\nI was born in mint condition, I'm everybody's life's mission\nAlright, listen, put me 'round your neck and I might glisten\nThe ultimate connect, I'll get you anything you need\nFrom good credit to good weed\nI can make any woman succeed\nControl you with a heart of greed\nAlong with anybody that's in need, I'll make 'em beg and plead\nI'm in the pocket of mafia crime lords and presidents\nWithout me, they'll evict you from your residence\nHov wrote about me on \"Dead Presidents,\" never irrelevant\nNot a soul on earth would love me if I weren't me\nNo matter what year I'm in, I'm current, see?\nPeople that have me, yeah, they power's so immense\nBut people without me, make no sense, god damn\nYeah, the world revolve around me, the law evolve around me\nThe shit people do to get a piece of me astound me\nBlood stains my face when drug deals go wrong\nI'm given to the greatest athletes when they go long\nYou could put me in check\nBut I'm still laughing all the way to the bank\nI'm the reason that the Titanic sank\nI'm always there for you, yeah, when it comes down to the wire And some people even tuck me away 'til they retire\nI usually come around on the first and fifteenth\nIf you owe me to somebody then they'll leave you beneath\nPeople go crazy when they feel me\nIn the Middle East they drill me\nIf you let your guard down, then some people'll steal me\nI knew these two dudes that's always been homies since fifth grade\nAlways schemin' on the block, selling crack to get paid\nNow they never graduated, thought that shit a charade\nOnly thing on they mind that wasn't me was get laid\nThen one day, they had a falling out on the block\nSee, one thought the other one had been stealing his rock\n'Cause he coulda sworn he had more weight in his stock\nPulled out the Glock and his homie yelled, \"Stop!\"\nBut before he had the chance to pull the trigger\nOh shit here come the cops\nThey saw the gun and blew them both away\nNow there's two more kids dead in the street all before twenty Over me, the most important thing to man: money\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n'Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n'Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high\n'Cause you never know when you're gonna go\nLife's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch\nLike Sinatra, screamin', \"Motherfuck the cops\"\n\nWe just some motherfuckin' kids\nWe just some motherfuckin' kids\n\nWe love and miss you, Mac\nFor those of y'all who don't know man, Mac is the whole reason that I started doing this Young Sinatra shit. I remember I loved Lord Finesse, all the shit he did with DITC, Diggin in the Crates. \"Hip to the Game\", one of like\u2014one of the illest beats ever and I remember when Mac flipped that shit for \"Kool-Aid and Frozen Pizza\"\u2014I thought it was the dopest shit man. Mac showed me that I could just do it all on my own\u2014me and all my boys, all my homies\u2014 and if it wasn't for him killing that beat I would have never got on that beat for my very first mixtape Young, Broke, & Infamous. Damn, that's like 2010. And I titled the track \"Young Sinatra.\" And that was the birth of all this shit. So, thank you, I appreciate you, love you and miss you, yeah\nYeah, we just some motherfuckin' kids32Embed"

You see, that\u2019s what I like to hear\nYou find out you\u2019re dead and the first thing you worry about is others\nMan, answer me, what about my family?\nWhat\u2019s going on with Vanessa?\nThey\u2019re doing just fine\nYou see, your wife was cheating on you\nWait, wait, the bitch did what?!\nAnd even though she loved you dearly\nShe was a bit relieved you would never find out\nWait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?\nHow you gon' tell me I\u2019m dead then gon' tell me my wife cheated on me?!\nAtom, none of that matters now\nWalk with me\nWait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?\nNo\nWell, I don\u2019t see no pitchforks\nLittle red people runnin' around\nIt ain\u2019t too hot up in here so I guess this ain\u2019t hell either\nI think the easiest way to describe it, this white void\nIs to look upon it as a waiting room\nSo...are you God?\nYes, I\u2019m God43Embed"

everybody gotta fight for equal rights\n'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites\nTo make it happen though we gon' need patience\nAnd not violence, giving hospitals more patients

I like it\nYeah, should I make it more surreal though, or...\nI think it's good, hey Bobby run it!62Embed"

This is my house, you fuckers just lease\nWaitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest\nBlack and white like a nun\nThese up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn\nSo follow your father like an apostle\nPaint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil\nNever knowing what's gon' follow\nHowever we never wallow in our sorrow\nJust pray for tomorrow\nAt times my heart could be hollow\nEmotions forced to be swallowed\nWhile neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo\nThis is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder\nLife's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you\nSo I'm trying to find her\nOne moment she'll love you then swallow\nYou whole like an anaconda\nThe bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky\nI'ma dominate the world like my name is Brain\nSpit flame like propane\nBitches I overcame you know the name\nInk in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page\nTo numb the pain like Novocaine, motherfucker\nYou might also like\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\n\nAllow me to kill it off the brake like no traffic\nMurderin' every demographic\nPaint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic\nGrip the mic to set the example\nWhile all these muh-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples\nConstant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die\nSociety expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I\nBut we persevere force feed enemies truth serum\nWe want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased\nIn your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest\nBustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it\nI get from point A to point B by keeping it G\nAin't no killer but don't push me\nIf you grab the heat, you a pussy\nKnuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel\nI have not a single enemy\nOnly evil entities that have some how befriended me, in they mind\n'Cause I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme\nAnd when it comes to dames I catch planes\nThey catch feelings\nHaters keep my name in they mouth like fillings\nHigh as the ceiling\nY'all really don't know who your dealing with now\nVisions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen\nThankful for every breath I'm givin'\nFuck social division\nOn the road to success and there ain't no time for collision\nPeople ask \"how you get your flow so amazing\"\nTo which I reply \"I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions\"\nHaters takin' shots but they never graze him\nNow if pro is the opposite of con\nWhat's the opposite of progress?\nI love my country but that shit a mess\nGrew up on section 8, I can attest\nAnd now they wonder why I claim that I'm the fucking best\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)\nI'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me\nNow if I don't believe it y'all won't perceive it\nNow run it back and retrieve it\nTill you receive it in your motherfuckin' mind\nOnly 22 but I feel like I'm 99\nBack in 1999, that's when I began to rhyme\nSurrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine\nDaddy was smoking crack, I was raised by a single mom\nFasting every night I ain't talking bout no Ramadan\nI was poor as fuck me and my mama, we didn't have a dime\nAt 16, the school system dismissed him and wished him well\nBut my mama never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?\nSo I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own\nI left home at 17\nShortly after my mama got stabbed by fucking around in the streets\nBut she still breathin' which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving\nSo many rappers biting me you would think they was teething\nAnd now you know this is just a sugar coated version within a fraction of a percentage that was taken from just a piece of my story52Embed"

Why do we die?\nAnd why do the people\nWho go against everything you ever said always get ahead?\nI've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right\nBut tonight, I am in this church\nAsking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me\nBecause I'm tired and I don't know what else to do\nSo black I'm blue, so brown I'm down\nI done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up\nI am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame\nAnd all I wanna do is believe in you\nThe darker you are, the closer you are to dirt\nAnd they make sure it hurts\nAnd I am tired of hurtin', man\nI'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared\nSo if you out there, do something about this\n'Cause I can't take it no more\nHelp me46Embed"

Or rather, my hypothesis\nI'm darker than Gotham is\nLike reading Nostradamus at 90 degrees\nYou better believe\nI know how to turn a profit with ease\nDiacritical lifestyle, I'm always overseas\nHurricane Bobby in the studio blowing trees\nSwitch the topic, I drop it\nFuck around then leave them all concussed\nWhen I bust, no thrust, this world we livin' in is fucked\nIndustry rule number four thousand and eighty one\nYour new shit ain't good as your old shit\n'Til your new shit is your old shit, son\nAnd then some, gotta get some\nI wear this 24 karat solid gold Rollie for my son\nAs an heirloom, not for looking dope as I rhyme\nAs a representation to give your family your time\nIf you're searching for love in the industry you'll be let down\nThey don't love you 'til you dead and then they call you profound\nNo matter how mainstream you was in the end, you still underground\nThat's the truth, feeling close to the cliff, like Rick Dalton in the booth\nMoney ain't the key to happiness and this the proof\nModern day rap is like a golden era spoof\nBut a few of us were searching within the second renaissance\nAnd I know that my debutantes\nBeen keeping the legacy going\nBy flowing so involuntarily seamless\nMe and my team is finally reaping\nWhat we been sowing like a seamstress\nI said I'm on one, I know I'm unsung\nWas livin' my life backward like Tariq on Undun\nAnd now they wonder how I got over son (Do you want more?)\nHell yeah, now check the method\nI been livin' outside of pages for ages\nNow I'm back, Chocolate City, home of percussion, Maryland on my back\nFrom Takoma Park, all the way to Southeast DC\nIt feel like forever ago, it feel like BC\nEverlasting life, kickin' rhymes in the parking lot at night\nInhale, exhale, people hate\nOh well, 2012\nDreamin' I'm a freshman on XXL\n2013, on the cover XXL\nLivin' life behind these bars with no intention of postin' bail\n'Cause I prevail\nBut that's a story for another time\nStory for another rhyme\nAnd on my darkest days, I know that the sun will shine, eventually\nGreatest lyricist to ever do it, yeah essentially\nAnd if we're being modest then potentially\nAnd if we're being humble then...\nYou might also like\n\nOh shit, it's Raquel, she's a fuckin' thot\nAyy, fuck you guys! Fuck you guys!\nSuck my dick!\nStraight on the basement mic\nAyy, man fuck all these punchlines and shit man\nI just wanna tell a story, I just wanna have some fun\nBack in the basement type shit\nAyo, once upon a time a couple of guys from out this world\nWas talkin' rap and hip hop with a young synthetic girl\nThe year was 2115 at Babel Space Station\nWas home to the very last of the human population\nThe captain name was Thomas, the infantry man was Kai\nAnd he's the man that discovered the Ultra 85\nAccompanied by a girl inside their ear, her name was Thalia\nMade of ones and zeros, she was a program\nYou could ask her any question even about the fall of man\nThen one day they discovered a planet in deep space\nThat nobody before them had ever found in they database\nI mean, maybe it's the place that's meant for the human race\nThe planet Paradise, Kai said to Thomas, \"My God\nIt'd be very nice, traveling through outer space\nWe done had some scary nights\nWe done had some scary fights\"\nAll about that rap shit, Kai like that trap shit\nThomas love that boom bap shit\n\"I wish God was real, I wish I could just get raptured\nWhat if this planet full of aliens and we get captured?\"\n\"Don't think that way, my son\nEverything gon' be fine, we finna have some fun\nAnd if by chance we do come across an alien\nI'ma blow his ass away with this here molecular gun\nSet to kill, never stun\nWagwan, we get it done\"\nNow the ship is enterin' the atmosphere (Ten, nine)\n\"We gon' take a look around and get the hell up outta here (Eight, seven)\nWe gon' double check that it's habitable and livable for man (Six, five)\nAnd no matter what happens you know we gon' stick to the plan\" (Four, three)\n\"Understood?\" \"Understand\", \"All good? Let's get it then\" (Two, one)\nOnce they touched down nobody could hear a sound\n'Til they opened up the ship door, that rappelled to the ground\nWhat they found, a planet full of life\nA planet full of shit they never seen\nStraight up out a movie scene\nOn some Tarantino meets Christopher Nolan, nah mean?\nWalk around the planet for hours, they was exhausted\nIf it wasn't for the music in they ears, they would have lost it\nThe seventh album by a musician they both revered\nFirst time this planet heard it, let's call it a world premiere\nThomas thinkin' about a picture of his girl\nThat he left on the Aquarius Three in his dresser\nWishin' he could undress her\nGive her the pipe, no lesser\nKai thinkin' nuts like a professor\nWondering if the oxygen on this planet fresher\nNow is it us or is the natural life on this world the aggressor?\nAll the negative shit inside of his head, he need a refresher\nTwo men here to save the world, no pressure40Embed"

Whipping through LA in the coupe de Ville\nOn the real, to various people I do appeal, 'cause of skill\nSo this the type of shit I'm gon' keep making\nThat make MCs break fast like flapjacks and bacon\nRest in peace to BIG, and many other fallen soldiers\nNever Hollywood, I'm grounded like a cup of Folgers, bitch I told ya\nAllow me to open up your mind and mold ya\nIndulge ya, within this shit I call the second Renaissance\nThe system broke and they sent Logic in for maintenance\n'Cause all you wack rappers couldn't break change to make sense\nI'm back again with another argument about how much I'm black again\nFighting for credibility from the lack of blacker skin\nIt's kind of funny how your pigment determines how people perceive you\nThat's ignant\nAin't seen my momma in a minute\n'Cause growing up she called me a nigg\u200ber\nThat would never amount to nothing\nRacism from my own momma, left home 'cause of drama\nBut I can make it in the rap game, look at Obama\nYou ain't been in my shoes, you don't know my story\nYou don't know what's in store, but bitch I stocked the inventory\nFuck a critic with the balls to try to tell me how I feel\nYou wasn't with me as a child, never once did you feel\nThe pain of my stomach that manifested from the lack of meals\nHeaded to the soup kitchen on foot by the lack of wheels\nWe aim to keep it real and hell no we ain't never missing\nCame a long way from eating when government gave permission\nIf you think these lyrics ain't deep, you too stupid to listen\nJust an outcast with a mission to spit to whoever listen, bitch, it's LogicYou might also like43Embed"

Visionaries never fail\nWhy-why you think I'm independent? Visionaries never f\u2014\nYou know what I been on, you know where I be at\n'Cause men lie, women lie, numbers don't, I see that\nCatch me in a private jet like, \"Fuck it, where the weed at?\"\nAnd this flight attendant got the fattest ass, you know I need that\nY-y-you know what I been on, you know where I be at\n'Cause men lie, women lie, numbers don't, I see that\nNow these bitches say they love me, but they just obsessed with the image\nYou know what I been on, you know where I be at (Sinatra)\n\n\"You gotta realize\nA lot of the time when I talk, and I'm talking extremely cocky\nI'm not talking about myself\nI'm talking about the work.\" You know where I be at\nLogic27Embed"

we're\u2005gonna\u2005bring up to\u2005the stage usually does not come\u2005in on Monday nights\nYou're in for a real treat, ladies and gentlemen\nGive it to Mr. Hall\n\nRip out my soul from the depths of my flesh\nFlesh from my blood I caress\nRight on the page so it's fresh\nI take my time, but express\nLot on my mind, but I guess\nIt's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene\nKick in the door, we blow it off the hinge\nMusic my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe\nIt's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend\nTherapist tell me I don't need to defend\nTherapy tell me I don't need to explain\nJust drop the record on the needle and express my pain\nCan't wait until my son shine and together we reign\nMy queen's by my side like Manhattan\nFuck rapping, this is poetic conviction\nMy rendition is not meant for your diction\nBattled addiction in the womb\nA crack baby by definition\nKeys to ignition with no permission\nThat mean that I'm driven\nAlive 'cause I'm living\nFuck workin' with what you've been given\nI knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five\nAnd I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did\n'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did\nDidn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid\nAll I knew was alcoholism and prison\nOnly saw domestic violence and racial division\nSocial worker trying to take me away\nBut I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way\nAt least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay\nAdapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay\nYou might also like\nKeep that one just in case, yeah\n\nI'm just an entity\nMy DNA, not my identity\nFinding serenity\nBecome a better man, I better be\nFor the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy\nWe get big bread\nTryin' to be the greatest, that shit been dead\nI'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead\nI'm trying to get ahead like a fetus\nMoney don't complete us, but it feed us, it can lead us to depression\nBeing rich is not a blessing, fame is not a blessing\nWasn't 'til I was rich and famous, I learned that lesson\nWhat's the meaning of life, to live it, what I'm guessing\n\nLive it, live it\nLiving life like this is so crazy\nHip-hop is amazing\nOne day, you're on top and the next, they want to erase 'em\nGoddamn, what I'm facing\nEvery day a new frustration\nPeople thinking I'm complacent\nPeople thinking that I changed like a cashier\nBut I can't let that register, get the fuck up on out of here\nBuy it, break it, roll it, light it, get high as the stratosphere\nI can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme\nGive it up, you're out of time\nNever even had a prime\nLike the Preemo never linked up with 5'9\"\nBitch, I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae\nOkay, fuck what you gotta say\nI keep it going, already know when I'm flowing\nFor the listener, you're kind of like a therapist\nOr rather Cole in 2005, flowing like Canibus\nThat throwback shit, yeah, that throwback shit\nFuck what you heard, my catalog, it ain't got no wack shit\n'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum, everybody wanna be him\n'Til they feel like they can't be him, then they wanna see him lose\nWrote this poem in navy, that's what I call singing the blues\nWord to Dot D, my family got me, no carbon copy\nLife can hit you harder than Drago\nBut if I roll with the punches when it's rocky, don't ever stop me\nNever top me, never cocky, I'm never cocky\nOkay, well, maybe sometimes\nOccasionally in some rhymes\nBut it's fine, in due time\nI'm the illest to ever do it, come now, Bobby Boy, cool it\nAn indigenous era of the indigenous emcee\nRiding this motherfucker 'til the tank on E\nWhat's up?\n(You-you-you-you-you)\n(You-you), yeah, uh\nYeah, uh, yeah (Yeah)\nUh, uh, yeah, yeah\n(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)\nUh, yeah\nUh, yeah\n(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)\n\nFuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside\nI wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride\nReflecting on memories from my childhood\nBringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good\nAll I ever gave a fuck about was my career\nBut all that shit out the window now that my son is here\nFuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams\nFuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less\nIf it ain't 'bout my happiness, then I could give a fuck less\nI remember window shopping\nNow I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room\nBobby coming soon\nAnd that's the type of line I would've second-guessed\nPutting on my shit before\nOut of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate\n'Cause it wasn't relevant\nGive a fuck if it's evident, this right here is the evidence\nI'm like Leo in Revenant, bear with me\nYou could tear me apart\nBut that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart\nWhere it's built from the start\nWhere it's finna stay\nI've learned every day's a good day\nSurrounded by people that love me\nDon't want nothing from me but my happiness\nOff the internet, that's when I'm at my happiest\nScrolling so much, my thumb fucked up\nWe call that carpal tunnel vision\nFollow me like religion on this course of collision\nFeeling imprisoned, and this is my freedom through these lyrics\nAs I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis\nAll this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus\nI think I finally found my paradise, that's word to Thomas52Embed"

Inspiration hits at any time\nSo I guess I'll have to conclude all my thoughts another time\nAnother rhyme\nAnother\u2014 Ano\u2014 i\u2014 wo\u2014 a\u2014 rhyme\nAnime such as Cowboy Bebop\nTrigun, and Samurai Champloo\nWere in constant rotation\nDuring the making of this album31Embed"

Money. Faith. Music. God. Fear. Bills. Friends. Enemies. Family. Music\n\nUh\nAyy\nYeah\nAre you ready?\nLogic\n\nStep into the mind of a young man\nAnd if you don't, then I don't really give a damn\nAll I wanna do is make you understand\nBut if you don't wanna listen, I guess you ain't a part of the plan\nSorry if I digress\nAll I ever wanted was to be the best\nThrough lyricism that put your mind to the test\nStayin' up, late night, no rest\nFeelin' bulletproof, no vest, but I confess\nMy mind's a mess, living in a world of stress, I digest\nBut I gotta keep grinding\n'Cause everyday success what I'm finding\nAnd I don't give a damn if you hate on me\n'Cause when I blow what you gon' say homie?\nHeh, not a goddamn thing\nBut that's enough of that, I'ma let my home girl sing\nYou might also like\nKnocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\nYou might be knocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\n\nAll I think about is music\nDon't get me wrong, I think\nAbout other things but this is how I fuse it\nSo the whole wide world can use it\nWhen you feel like you just might lose it\nTake a breath, homie, don't confuse it\nTake a step in the mind of Logic\nAs long as you don't abuse it\nSo let me break it down for the whole world\nLike I broke it down for my old girl\nI can't deal with your bullshit\nNo more, gotta let it go, let it unfurl\n'Cause I remember the time\nWhen I was living sublime, wanted to make a living off of my rhymes\nBut the whole world told me never mind\nI'm a star, how could I not shine?\nKnocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\nYou might be knocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\nI just wanna take it to another level\nThat I never even been on so I can sit on\nEvery single piece of paper that I put a pen on\nAnd when I been on for like ten years\nI'ma do it better than anybody before me\nSo the whole wide world will adore me, ain't no need to assure me\nAnd if you wonder why I'm rapping so fast\nIt's 'cause I gotta lot of things on my mind\nThat wanna come out at the same time\nIn other words I'm racin'\nI used to pursue my dreams\nBut now they're reality and that's what I'm chasin'\nWhy are we on this Earth?\nWhy must we feel pain?\nWhy does everybody feel the need\nTo judge one another when we're all the same?\nKnocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)\nYou might be knocked down, round for round\nYou're feeling like you're shot down on the ground\nWhen will the fantasy end? (Yeah)\nWhen will the heaven begin? (Yeah)46Embed"

Okay\nYou want to hear about my everyday\nI wake up, I wake my son up, then I feed him\nAnd lead him into his car seat\nDrive up the street down to Target\nDon't do hard drugs or beat my wife\nBut the paparazzi still wanna start shit\nI don't answer their questions, I leave 'em in the dark, bitch\nThen I walk through the automatic doors\nA couple fans spot me but, shit, I ain't on tour\nI ain't trying to ignore her\nBut I head to aisle four 'cause my drawers stank as fuck\nAnd I need some new drawers\nThen I spot some more fans, stan hella hardcore (Can I have a picture?)\nAsking for a pic and I say sure\nScratch my dick and shake his hand\nShaking uncontrollably, he tells me I'm the man\nNow I'm headed to aisle three for some Bounty paper towels\nI also grab some wet wipes to clean the shit from my bowels\nA really hot girl walks by with a fat ass\nBut I'm just wondering if Hefty really holds the most trash\nForgot my card at home, thank God I brought some cash\nThen I grab some Preparation H for the critics up my ass\nHead to aisle five for some Sgt. Smash cereal\nIs this want you wanted, everyday life material?\nI'm not a kid anymore and be sure shit's boring\nMade it out the basement, now my bank account soaring\nMost exciting part of my life is probably touring\nDon't get me wrong, I love fans in every single city\nBut hotels suck and the internet is shitty\nI mean, why rap about everyday shit\nWhen I could murder punch lines and sound dope like this?\nChillin' with the homies at the crib\nBumpin' Pac Div, this the life I live, you ain't know about it\nHit the studio with No I.D.\u200b\nMake a couple platinum records in that bitch and then I dip up out it\nOn the 101, my wife text me\nTalkin' 'bout, \"You gotta get home, feed your son,\" girl, don't trip about it\nWalk up in with apple sauce and broccoli\nLittle Bobby, better eat your greens, boy, don't give me lip about it\n\nHello, no one is available to take your call\nPlease leave a message after the tone\nBro, call me back\nWe couldn't get the fuckin' Super **** sample cleared again, so fuckin' annoying, bro\nBut honestly, I just say that we chop up the Toro y Moi joint\nThat we were gonna put on Ultra 85\nAnd just like flip, fuckin' freak the shit outta that joint\nI think it could be crazy\nCall me back, I'ma chop it up on the MPC\nHere I go21Embed"
