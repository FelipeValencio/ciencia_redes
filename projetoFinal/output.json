Somebody else\'s child Caught in gun smoke and we, can all make a change So I\'m told, but I haven\'t seen the change unfold I\'ll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe Communities in need of people that will lead Keep your eyes open, I can only say I\'ll try Until the day I die, I promise to be wise With my heart open, greed brings only misery A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise Don\'t be afraid to try, too many of us die For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies  We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate ‘Cause by then it\'s just too late, there\'s so much we can take And there\'s only so much someone can swallow and tolerate To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it\'s all it takes You think that we was learnin\' from other rappers\' mistakes But we ain\'t, its grain to go against With every artist comes the image he portrays And the picture that he paints But in the midst of all this anger and this angst Never once did you hear me say I\'m a gangster And I ain\'t hear no complaints But I know that I will always continue to grow As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else\'s shadow There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee That\'s why the fuck I remain sucker free To this day, the game will never be the same No matter how much fame and success they attain There will never be another me And no matter what they do, there will never be another you You can search, but you\'ll never find You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds We will never die, we are forever alive And we continue growin\', one day at a time You might also like Don\'t get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype Rappers are regular people minus money and lights Searchin\' for fortune and fame and superstardom All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew\'s the hardest There\'s not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin\' And the kids think beef is they only option Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged My memories of Kadaf\' while Makaveli lives on You think the industry is fun, ain\'t no pity with guns And when your money is up, that\'s when your enemies come So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap? We needin\' a change, the drama remains the same  I spend my whole life fightin\' myself That I can\'t win, so I\'m invitin\' some help And every now and then, I take rights from the left I\'m still, just like a kid, lookin\' for stripes on my belt Yeah, and that there is a fight in itself So I just pray and hope God, take a like to myself No matter how much I try to stay alive I\'ma die a man, still standin\' and in love with my pride  Heard frivolous beats, we past that I\'m tryin\' to keep some income coming in And collect on my ASCAP The rappers in the game ain\'t changed (No) And I finally realize that we\'re not in the same game The hatin\' will never end, so I guess I\'ll deal with it Them .45\'s will pop killas, yes, I\'m still with it The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin\' One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind And we continue growin\', one day at a time, damn17Embed 67 ContributorsWhat’z Ya Phone\xa0# Lyrics What\'s your phone number?

Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists\' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac\'s – excuse me – Makaveli\'s verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why\'d they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:  It\'s not about East or West It\'s about niggas and bitches Power and money, ridaz and punks Which side are you on? *Heartbeat* *Gunshots* *Encroaching footsteps* These niggas is still fuckin\' talkin\'? You niggas still breathin\'?

Nothin\' but love for you, my sister Might even know how hard it is, no doubt Bein\' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt Shit, in this white man\'s world Sometimes we overlook the fact That we be ridin\' hard on our sisters We don\'t be knowin\' the pain we be causin\' In this white man\'s world In this white man\'s world I ain\'t sayin I\'m innocent in all this I\'m just sayin\', in this white man\'s world This song is for y\'all For all those times that I messed up, or we messed up  Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison, I miss ya Cryin\', lookin\' at my niece\'s and my nephew picture They say don\'t let this cruel world get ya Kinda suspicious, swearin\' one day you might leave me For somebody that\'s richer Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow Readin\' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet If brothers don\'t receive they mail, best believe we riot Eatin\' Jack-Mack, starin\' at the walls of silence Inside this cage where they capture all my rage and violence In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches Apologies to my true sisters, far from bitches Help me raise my Black nation, reparations are due It\'s true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls Born black in this white man\'s world—and all I heard was You might also like Who knows what tomorrow brings In this world where everyone\'s blind? And where to go, no matter how far, I\'ll find To let you know that you\'re not alone  Only thing they ever did wrong (Yes!, yes!) was bein\' born black (no doubt), in this white man’s world. All my ghetto motherfuckers, be proud to be black if you proud to have this shit like this, \'cause ain\'t nobody got it like this (all my little black seeds, born black in the white man\'s world). All these motherfuckers wanna be like us. They all wanna be like us, to be the have-nots: all hail. God bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin\' doubt.  Bein\' born with less, I must confess, only adds on to the stress Two gunshots to my homie\'s head, died in his vest Shot him to death and left him bleedin\' for his family to see I pass his casket, gently askin\', is there a heaven for G\'s? My homeboy\'s doin\' life, his baby mama be stressin\' Sheddin\' tears when her son finally ask that questions Where my daddy at? Mama, why we live so poor? Why you cryin\'? Heard you late night through my bedroom door Now, do you love me, mama? Why they keep on callin\' me nigga? Get my weight up with my hate and pay \'em back when I\'m bigger And still thuggin\' in this jail cell, missin\' my block Hearin\' brothers screamin\' all night, wishin\' they\'d stop Proud to be black, but why we act like we don\'t love ourselves? Don\'t look around, busta, (You sucka!) check yourselves Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl We still strugglin\' in this white man\'s world Who knows what tomorrow brings (Born black in this white man\'s world) In this world where everyone\'s blind? (In this white man\'s world) And where to go, no matter how far, I\'ll find (In this white man\'s world) To let you know that you\'re not alone  We must fight for brother Mumia We must fight for brother Mutulu And we must fight for brother Ruchell Magee We must fight for brother Geronimo Pratt We must fight for , Zulu,  We must fight for the countless political prisoners Who are locked up falsely by this white man  So, tell me why you changed to choose a new direction In the blink of an eye? My time away just made perfection Did you think I\'d die? Not gon\' cry, why should I care? Like we holdin\' onto lost love that\'s no longer there Can you please help me? God bless me, please keep my seeds healthy Makin\' all my enemies bleed while my G\'s wealthy Hopin\' they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells Just in case they trip in Heaven—ain\'t no G\'s in Hell Sister, sorry for the pain that I caused your heart I know I\'ll change if you help me, but don\'t fall apart Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil\' Yummy, and Kato Too much for this cold world to take, ended up bein\' fatal Every woman in America, especially black Bear with me, can\'t you see that we under attack? I never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama Hope we make it to better times, in this white man\'s world Who knows what tomorrow brings In this world where everyone\'s blind? And where to go, no matter how far, I\'ll find To let you know that you\'re not alone  "You\'re out of touch with reality! There are a few of you in a few smoke-filled rooms calling that the mainstream, while the masses of the people—white and black, red, yellow and brown, poor and vulnerable—are suffering in this nation."

Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists\' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac\'s – excuse me – Makaveli\'s verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why\'d they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:  It\'s not about East or West It\'s about niggas and bitches Power and money, ridaz and punks Which side are you on? *Heartbeat* *Gunshots* *Encroaching footsteps* These niggas is still fuckin\' talkin\'? You niggas still breathin\'?

Walk blind into a line or fight? Fight and die if we must Die, like niggas  This is for the masses, the lower classes, ones you left out Jobs were given, better living, but we were kept out Made to feel inferior, but we\'re superior Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us Honor a man that refuses to respect us Emancipation Proclamation? Please Lincoln just said that to save the nation These are lies that we all accepted Say no to drugs, but the governments\' kept it Running through our community, killing the unity The war on drugs is a war on you and me And yet, they say this is the home of the free You ask me, it\'s all about hypocrisy The constitution, yo, it don\'t apply to me And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me This may be strong, and no one\'s gonna like what I\'m pumpin\' But its wrong to keep someone from learning something So get up, its time to start nation building I\'m fed up, we gotta start teaching children That they can be all that they want to be There\'s much more to life than just poverty This is definitely, uh, words of wisdom You might also like America!
